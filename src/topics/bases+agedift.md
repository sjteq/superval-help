# Spouse’s Age Difference Table

This field is used to enter an age-dependent table if the age difference
between a member and their spouse varies according to the member’s age.
It is used when valuing death benefits prior to retirement and
contingent annuities on death after retirement. For pensioners death
benefits prior to retirement may occur when the [Benefit Commencing
Age](pensioners_basis+bage.md) is after the member’s current age.

Double click to select the `AD` table that contains the relevant data.
The table should contain the values for Member’s Age minus Spouse’s Age
ie if Members are 3 years older than their spouse enter `3`.

This field is only available to some users.
