# Calculation Date

The Calculation Date to which the calculation is performed.

This defaults to the Current Valuation Date. You can overwrite this if
you wish as the calculation can be carried out at dates other than the
valuation date provided there is sufficient data.

Dates can be entered in almost any format and they will be automatically
converted to DD/MM/YYYY format.
