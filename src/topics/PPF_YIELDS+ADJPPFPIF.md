## PPF Yields - Post Retirement (no increases) Adjustment

SuperVal calculates the PPF yields in accordance with the Guidance issued from the PPF  and documented in Guidance Notes A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8 and A9. 

This field can be used to make adjustment to this calculation, i.e. to reflect Guidance prior to A3 or when new Guidance is issued.

Enter the adjustment that applies to the yield used for compensation
with no increases in payment. The adjustment is additive, i.e. if the
calculated yield is 3.25% and `0.25` is entered, the revised yield will be
3.50%.
