# Message Display Time

Messages appearing with a progress bar (such as the Log Off message)
will be displayed for the period specified here (in seconds). These
messages can be cleared earlier by simply pressing the OK button.

This message display is also used for any Error messages resulting from
a valuation run in Unattended mode. This ensures that subsequent
valuations will be run rather than waiting for user intervention to
clear the error message.
