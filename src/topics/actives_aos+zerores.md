# Zero Retrospective Reserve

For valuation methods that use a retrospective reserve (that is,
Attained Age Normal, Projected Unit Credit and Defined Accrued Benefit
methods), you are able to specify whether the Reserve should be zero for
new entrants at entry.

Leave this field unchecked if new entrants are able to transfer in
periods of membership or additional pension amounts, when a non-zero
Reserve at Entry would be expected.

Check this field if all new entrants have no previous fund accruals.

Note that the Reserve calculated by the system for new entrants with no
previous fund accruals only differs from zero due rounding in the
interpolation between Reserves.
