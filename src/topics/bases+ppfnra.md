# PPFNRA

On the Legislation Tab, enter the NRA to be attached to the GMP, which
is converted in to excess pension, for PPF valuations.

Elsewhere, for Actives and Deferreds, select from the drop-down list
which of the previously defined PPF NRAs applies to the pension or
benefit slice. The PPF NRAs are specified on the PPF/Cap Tab.

For Pensioners enter the normal retirement age to be used as the PPF NRA
in the PPF (S179 Levy) Valuation. The PPF NRAs are only used to
determine the level of capping required. They do not override the
Benefit Commencing Age. To allow for ill health retirements, use a
sufficiently low age so that all members exceed this age i.e. 16. To allow
for early retirement pensions, use an age such as 50.
