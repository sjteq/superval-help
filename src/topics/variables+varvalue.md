# Variable Value

Enter the Global value for the variable or constant.

The rate can be input as either a single rate, a vector or a yield
curve.

For a single rate, enter the value. For 6% enter `6` and not `0.06`.

For a vector, enter the appropriate rates i.e. if 3 4 5 was entered then
the rate of increase would be 3%, 4% and 5% in the first and second year
after the valuation date and 5% thereafter.

For a yield curve, right click to choose the CSV file containing the
relevant data. The CSV file should contain one row with a maximum of 200
numbers i.e. 200 columns. The CSV file should be saved in the input
folder.
