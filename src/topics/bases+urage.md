# Underpin: Retirement (Normal and Early)

This and the following fields affect the `Cash Flow Summary` page in the
Excel/Consolidation Output only. They do not have any effect on the
Valuation Results.

If you have selected `Tables` for the field [Pension Benefits
Capitalised or Spread](bases+capind.md) then select a rate table
containing the age at which you want the Underpin (excess) liability on
Retirement to appear in the Cash Flow. The table will be indexed by age
nearest at start of the year of retirement.

Typically tables entered here would be of `EX` type.

Example Table would have entries as follows:

Age at Retirement | Age Underpin shown
------------------|-------------------
60 | 77
61 | 77
62 | 77
63 | 78
64 | 78
65 | 78
