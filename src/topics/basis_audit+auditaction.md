Select `Produce Audit Report` to create Audit Reports for the selected
basis files.

Select `Apply Audit Check Points` to create a reference point (which
will be the last Date/Time saved) from which audit records can be
compared. This gives the user the option to audit only the changes made
since the last Check Point.
