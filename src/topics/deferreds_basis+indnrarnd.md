# NRA Exits Rounding Override

The user has the option to enter an override for the [NRA Exits
Rounding](deferreds_basis+nrarnd.md) entered on the Financial Tab.

Select from the drop-down list how the override rounding for exits at
NRA should be calculated. The revaluation of the PUP to Normal
Retirement Age will be based on the exact duration between Valuation
Date and Normal Retirement Date, rounded according to the parameter
entered. The options are:

-   Exact Days
-   Months Rounded Down
-   Nearest Months
-   Months Rounded Up
-   Years Rounded Down
-   Nearest Years
-   Years Rounded Up
-   Complete Tax Years

The discounting of the benefit will be based on years nearest.

If you do not wish to use this option then leave blank.
