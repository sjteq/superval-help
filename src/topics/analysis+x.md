# Upper Limit of Age Ranges

You must specify the age ranges to be used in the analysis. The values
specified represent the upper limits of the ranges.

The first group will include all ages less than or equal to the first
value and data beyond the last limit specified will be grouped into a
final group.

Enter the age ranges as a vector of ages, e.g. `20 30 40 60`.
