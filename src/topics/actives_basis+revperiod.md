# Curtate Reval Period

Check this box if exits before NRA should only receive revaluations for
each complete year. Leave the box unchecked to allow for the extra
half-year revaluation.

Exits before NRA, such as early retirement and death in deferment, are
assumed to occur half-way through the year i.e. 0.5, 1.5, 2.5 years after
the valuation date. By checking this box, these benefits will receive
deferred revaluations for the number of complete years only i.e. 0, 1, 2.
If the box is unchecked, the benefits will receive an additional
half-year of revaluation i.e. 0.5, 1.5, 2.5.
