# Statutory GMP Inc to NRA&gt;SPA

This field determines the pension increases that are used to increase
the GMP between SPA and NRA for retirements after SPA.

Check the box to increase GMPs by 
1/7%  per week,
then by the assumed statutory GMP increases from SPA to NRA. The
statutory GMP increases are hard-coded in SuperVal and are assumed to be
0% annually for Pre-1988 GMP and 3% annually for Post-1988 GMP.

Leave the box unchecked to increase the GMPs by 1/7%
per week, then by the user specified pension escalation in payment
from SPA to NRA. The pension increases in payment are those specified
for [Pre-1988 GMP](bases+b88gmpinc.md) and [Post-1988 GMP](bases+a88gmpinc.md) 
respectively on the Financial tab.

SuperVal only applies the Late Retirement uplift after the member completes 
seven weeks post state pension age (60 for women and 65 for men) as stated 
in the legislation.
