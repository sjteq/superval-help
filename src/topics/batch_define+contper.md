# Control Period

A Control Period (expressed in years) is required for either the
Projected Unit Credit or the Defined Accrued Benefit valuation methods.

For the Projected Unit Credit method, enter the period over which the
`Normal Cost` will be calculated.

For the Defined Accrued Benefit method, enter the period over which
funding towards the target Accrued Benefit is achieved. (Please note
this can also be modified when consolidating these runs.)
