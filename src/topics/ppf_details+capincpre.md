# Pre Discontinuance Pension Increase

The PPF Benefit Cap can be applied to the Accrued Benefits for non-PPF
valuation runs by selecting `Cap Accrued Benefits` in the Batch
Parameters. The Benefit Cap applied will be taken from the PPF Global
Parameters and increases to the point of discontinuance with this field.
The projected Accrued Benefits page in the Consolidation output will
show the discontinuance liabilities calculated at yearly intervals
following the Valuation Date based on the projected Cap.

Select from the drop-down list the Global Financial Parameter that
contains the rate applicable. Once selected, the current value of the
Global Financial Parameter is shown to the right of this field.

To add a new Global Financial Parameter use the Edit Scheme Financials
button at the bottom of this Tab.
