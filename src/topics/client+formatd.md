# Format of Main Deferreds File

The Data Format of Main Deferred Pensioners Data File.

A data format is saved parameters specifying the column specification of
each of the data items contained in the data file.

Data format descriptions are prefixed by an indication of the type of
format e.g. &lt;Def&gt; for Deferreds.

If you currently have no deferreds data formats for this Scheme, you may
leave this field blank and select the data format subsequently once you
have created the data format.
