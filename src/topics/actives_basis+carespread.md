# CARE Spreading Method

Select from the drop down how to spread CARE Benefit Accrual. The
options are:

-   Accrued Service
-   Accrued Pension

Under Accrued Service the benefits are spread using the ratio of service
from valuation date to the point of exit divided by service from start
date to the point of exit.

Under Accrued Pension the benefits are spread using the ratio of the sum
of future pension divided by the sum of total pension.
