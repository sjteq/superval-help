# Amortisation Interest Rate

This is the annual rate at which the amortisation contributions will be
discounted. This will typically be the same as the discount rate.

Select from the drop-down list the Global Financial Parameter that
contains the rate applicable. Once selected the current value of the
Global Financial Parameter is shown to the right of this field.

To add a new Global Financial Parameter use the _Edit Scheme Financials_
button at the bottom of this tab.
