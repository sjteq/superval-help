# Date Input Fields

You can specify up to two date data fields to be used in the calculation of the new numeric or date input data field.

For each of these date input data fields, it is necessary to specify the start and end columns of where the date data item is located in the input data file.

Date fields may be in any format which must be specified as a combination of 2 or 4 `Y`s, 2 `M`s and 2 `D`s with either `-` or `/` as a delimiter.

A right click allows you to select a date data field defined in the data format specified.
