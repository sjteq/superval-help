# Salary/Deduction/Salary Maximum Adjustment Factor

This field is a loading adjustment for the salary.

This option could be used where the member data was out of date and
needs to be increased to take account of an extra half year of salary
inflation. The multiplier could be set to `1.04` if salary increases were
at 8% p.a.
