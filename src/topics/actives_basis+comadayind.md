Users sometimes value Cash on Top in the Ind Slices and Ind PUPs giving
data items the same payment start and end age. If the intention is to
include this Cash on Top amount in the A Day max calculation, then this
box should be checked.

If this box is unchecked the system will still value cash amounts in the
Ind Slices and Ind PUPs but the A Day maximum will not be reduced to
allow for this Cash on Top (if the basis has `Percentage of A Day Cash`
commutation specified).
