If checked, the data items loaded for GMP i.e. GMP0 and GMPE0 will be
assumed to be the Pre-1988 GMP and Post-1988 GMP at Date of Leaving
respectively. SuperVal will revalue the GMP to Date of Valuation using
the Fixed Rate Revaluations hard-coded into SuperVal based on the
member’s Date of Exit. The GMP will be revalued using the number of
Tax Years between Date of Leaving and State Pension Age less Tax Years
between Date Of Valuation and State Pension Age. If NRA is greater than
SPA, then Statutory Late Retirement Factors are applied.

If unchecked, SuperVal will assume the data items GMP0 and GMPE0 are the
Pre-1988 GMP and Post-1988 GMP as at Date of Valuation.

SuperVal will revalue the GMP from date of valuation in line with the
information specified on the Legislation tab.
