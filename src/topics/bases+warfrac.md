# Spouse’s Fraction

The field determines the proportion of pension paid to a spouse in the
event of the member’s death in retirement ( i.e. normal, early or ill
health retirement). This can either be a fixed percentage for all
members or a member specific percentage.

To value a fixed percentage for all members enter the figure here. For
50% enter `50`.

To value a member specific percentage, select from the drop-down list
the data item containing the member specific spouse’s proportion. The
data item should be in the form of a percentage so for 50% enter `50`.

Users will have the option to override this value on the Slices or PUPs
Tab for a particular benefit.
