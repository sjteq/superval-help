# The Print button

Pressing the _Print_ button enables the printing of Rate Tables. The Rate
Tables printed will depend on the node that is highlighted when the
Print button is pressed as follows:

-   If the top node (with the Rate Table filename) is highlighted, a
printout of all Rate Tables on that Rate Table file will be
prepared.
-   If Rate Table type description is highlighted, a printout of all
Rate Tables of that type on that Rate Table file will be prepared.
-   If an individual Rate Table is highlighted, a printout of that
particular Rate Table will be prepared.
