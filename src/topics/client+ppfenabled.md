Check this box to enable the user to edit the PPF parameters and run all
types of PPF valuations. This will also automatically enable the Non PPF
Capped parameters and runs. (The box will become ticked and greyed out.)

If this box is unchecked then the Relevance Rules will grey out all of
the PPF Parameters that are not used. The user will then be able to
decide whether to enable the Non PPF Capped parameters and runs
separately.
