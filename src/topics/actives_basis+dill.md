# Mortality Rate Parameters

These parameters are only available if you have specified an ill health
decrement.

Select from the drop-down list the Global Mortality Rate Parameters to
use. The Parameter will be referenced by the name given when saving in
the Global Mortality Parameters. Migrated parameters include:

-   the percentage adjustment made to the table
-   the table name or code
-   the age rating that is applied to the table.

If "None" is selected then table D000 is selected automatically, the
values are set to 0 at all ages i.e. zero mortality.
