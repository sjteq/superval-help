# PUP Adjustment Factor

A negative or positive loading can be applied to the PUP.

Enter the number as a multiplier i.e. `1.1` for a 10% increase or `0.9` for a
10% decrease. If no adjustment is required enter `1`. If `0` is entered the
liability for the PUP will be zero.

This field can be used to allow for any contingencies, such as
childrenâ€™s pensions, which are not valued by SuperVal.
