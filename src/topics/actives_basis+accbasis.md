# Benefit Basis

Select from the drop-down list whether the benefits described on this
Slice are a Final Salary benefit or Career Average Revalued Earnings
(CARE) benefit.

If Final Salary is selected then the benefit calculated from this Slice
will increase in line with salary increases until retirement or earlier
exit. The salary increase used will be taken from the [Salary Increase
Rate](actives_basis+salinc.md) on the Financial Tab unless this has
been overridden by the [Salary Increase
Override](actives_basis+salinf.md) field on the Salary Tab.

If CARE is selected then the benefit calculated from this Slice will
increase in line with the [CARE Revaluation
Rate](actives_basis+salrev.md) on the Financial tab. Note that for past
service CARE Slices the pension amount as at the Valuation Date is
needed and should be entered as a [Fixed
Pension](actives_basis+fixpen.md) in Tiers 1, 2 or 3.
