# Basis\_Update+TargetFile

Specify a name for the new Basis File file. The filename specified must
not already exist as it will not overwrite an existing file.

Double Clicking will activate the standard Windows Open File Dialog
box for selection of a file (which can be used as a starting point for
the name of the file).

SuperVal will save the new Basis File in the current Input Folder.
