# GMP: Complete Years Pre NRA

This field is only available if [Revaluation Rate to NRA&lt;
SPA](deferreds_basis+presparev.md) is populated.

Exits before NRA, such as early retirement and death in deferment, are
assumed to occur half-way through the year i.e. 0.5, 1.5, 2.5 years after
the valuation date. By checking this box, the GMP will receive
revaluations for the number of complete years only i.e. 0, 1, 2. If the
box is unchecked, the GMP will receive an additional half-year of
revaluation i.e. 0.5, 1.5, 2.5.
