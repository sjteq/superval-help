# Proportion Married Table

Double click to select the table containing the proportion married for
members at each age.

In ongoing runs, these fields are used to determine the proportion of
the member’s benefit paid to a spouse or partner on death in service
(actives only), death in deferment or death after retirement. The field
[Spouse’s Definition](bases+spmethod.md) enables you to select how the
proportion married is applied.

In PPF runs the fields in the Scheme PPF parameters can be used to enter
the proportion married separately for male and female spouses and male
and female partners.

If 90% of members are assumed to be married at all ages then enter a
table containing `0.9`.

More information is available in the Infocus Document called Proportion
Married.
