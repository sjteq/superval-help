The Migration Wizard will show the structure of pointers and the value
that will be created for each of the Global Variable i.e. Interest Rate,
Revaluation Rates, Inflation Rate, Pension Increase Rate, Mortality
Rates and Mortality Improvement Rates, Contribution Rates and New
Entrants Tables.

Under each Parameter that will be created will be a list of all the
categories and the field where this will used. The Parameter Setting
will show the value, vector or yield curve name that this Global
Parameter will have. At this point the pointer names can be amended,
cloned or deleted via the Right Click Menu.

To amend the pointer name, click once slowly and a box will appear
around the existing name. This can then be changed. Remember, the user
should ensure all names and descriptions are generic i.e. Interest Rate
1 so that if the value of the assumption changes in future the pointer
name is still valid.

To clone a pointer, right click once on the pointer you wish to clone.
This can then be renamed. Any existing Global Variables that should be
underneath this pointer can be moved using click and drag.

To delete a pointer, right click and select delete. This option is only
available if there are no variable using this pointer.

At this stage the User should ensure that the pointers established are a
true and accurate reflection of all the different possible assumptions
required to value the scheme, in particular taking care to set up
separate pointers for assumptions that by coincidence were the same at
the previous valuation.
