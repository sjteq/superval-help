# Entry Date Indicator

This field is used to separate the results of the Analysis between
members at the previous valuation date (Old) and new entrants since the
previous valuation (Starters). Select from the drop-down list whether to
split based on Company Service or Scheme Membership. The options are:

-   Scheme
-   Company

If Scheme is selected the age at entry will be determined from the
standard data item DJF (Date Joined for Pensionable Service). If Company
is selected the age at entry will be determined from the standard data
item DJS (Date Joined for Company Service).
