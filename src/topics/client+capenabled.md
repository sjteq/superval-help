If `PPF Calculations required` has been checked then this box will
automatically be checked and greyed out. The Non PPF Capped runs
parameters will be available to edit in the Basis files and Non PPF
Capped valuations will be enabled.

If `PPF Calculations required` has not been checked then the user will
have the option to decide whether or not to enable the Non PPF Capped
parameters and runs independently. Check the box to enable these
parameters and runs. Leave the box unchecked to disable the Non PPF
Parameters that are not used in the Basis Files.
