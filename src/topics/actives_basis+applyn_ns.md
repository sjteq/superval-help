# Guarantee Leaving Benefit of N/NS

Check this box if you want the benefits on withdrawal to be compared to
the potential withdrawal benefit using service to retirement adjusted to
reflect actual service over potential service i.e. N/NS. Leave this box
unchecked if the deferred pension should not be compared.

The benefit paid will be increased to this minimum benefit where this is
higher than the calculated accrued benefit.

If selected you will then be asked to enter the [N/NS Maximum
Service](actives_basis+n_nsmaxserv.md).
