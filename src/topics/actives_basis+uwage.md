# Cash Flow Parameters: Leaving Age

This and the fields `Retirement Age` only affect the `Cash Flow Summary`
page in the Excel/Consolidation Output. They do not affect the Valuation
Results.

If you have selected `Tables` for the field `Underpin Method` then
double click to select a rate table containing the age at which you want
the Underpin (excess) liability on Withdrawal to appear in the Cash
Flow. The table will be indexed by age nearest at start of the year of
leaving service. Typically tables entered here would be of `EX` type.

Example: Table would have entries as follows:

Age at Leaving | Age Underpin shown
---------------|-------------------
40 | 70
41 | 70
42 | 71
43 | 71
44 | 71
45 | 72
