# Service Start Date/Earliest Start Date

The Service Start Date for each Slice is entered here. Select from the
drop-down list the data item containing the relevant data item. This
will be used as the date when service for this Slice starts accruing
unless an Earliest Start Date is also defined.

The user can define the Earliest Start Date that can be used for a
particular Slice. Enter this date in the following date format
DD/MM/CCYY. SuperVal will then take the later of these two dates to
determine when service for this Slice starts accruing.

If valuing future service, the Service Start Date on Slice 1 should be
`Valuation Date` and the Earliest Start Date should be blank. If you
have no future service liabilities, please ensure these fields are left
blank on Slice 1.

If the Slice is being used to value added years or a fixed pension then
these field can be left blank.

The Earliest Start Date will not be used for future service benefits on
Slice 1 when CARE benefits are being valued.
