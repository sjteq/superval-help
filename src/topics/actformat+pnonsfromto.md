# Previous Data Column Specifications

If Analysis of Surplus calculations are required it is necessary, for
each of the numeric non-standard data fields, to specify the start and
end columns of where the data item applicable at the previous valuation
date is located in the data file.

If the value of a numeric field has not changed over the inter-valuation
period, the same columns (exactly) can be specified for both the current
and previous data items.
