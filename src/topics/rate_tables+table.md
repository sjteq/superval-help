# Rate Tables

The top node has the name of the Decrement File that is being displayed.
This is the Decrement File for the Scheme that is contained in the
Scheme Details.

Each type of Rate Tables has a parent node with a description of the
Rate Tables. Rate Tables are displayed in the following order:

-   Decrement Rates
-   Salary Scales
-   Durational Weights
-   Proportion Married
-   New Entrant Tables
-   Annuity Tables
-   Miscellaneous tables.

Within each type Rate Tables are ordered by the Rate Table number.

Once an individual rate table has been selected, a graph of the rate
table is shown on the upper right section of the screen. Double clicking
on the graph will expand this. Once expanded, you can right-click to
obtain additional functionality i.e. printing.

See the Infocus document called Using Rate Tables for more information
on this area of SuperVal.
