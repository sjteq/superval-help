# Underpin: Death Age

This and the following fields affect the `Cash Flow Summary` page in the
Consolidation Output only. They therefore do not have any effect on the
Valuation Results.

If you have selected `Tables` for the field [Pension Benefits
Capitalised or Spread](bases+capind.md) then select a rate table
containing the age at which you want the Underpin (excess) liability on
Death in Deferment to appear in the Cash Flow. The table will be indexed
by age nearest at start of the year of death.

Typically tables entered here would be of `EX` type.

Example Table would have entries as follows:

Age at Leaving | Age Death Underpin shown
---------------|-------------------------
35 | 55
36 | 55
37 | 56
38 | 56
39 | 56
40 | 57
41 | 57
42 | 57
43 | 58
44 | 58
45 | 58
