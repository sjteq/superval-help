## Fixed Interest 10 years Gilt Yield

Enter the FTSE Fixed Interest 10 year Gilt Yield as at the Applicable
Date. (SuperVal will calculate the annualised yield.)

This yield will be used in the calculation of Yield B (pre 31 March 2008
valuations) and Yield C (valuations between 31 March 2008 and 30 October
2009).  The annualised yield will be calculated as follows:

$$\left( 1 + \frac{Fixed Interest_{10yr Yield}}{2} \right)^{2} - 1$$

The adjustment required to Yield B (pre 31 March 2008 valuations) and
Yield C (valuations between 31 March 2008 and 30 October 2009) is
documented in the Guidance from the PPF and is determined by the date of
valuation.  SuperVal automatically allows for the adjustments documented
in Guidance Note A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8 and A9.     

The yield is entered as a percentage, i.e. for 3% enter `3` and not `0.03`.
