# Grouping of Results

The Grouping of Data factor determines the size of the age sub-divisions
used to summarise investigation results output to the file (or in the
review of the investigation, the graphical display).

Note that the results for all ages are calculated (and saved). The
Grouping of Data factor can be adjusted when reviewing the investigation
results.
