# Service Rounding Override

The Company Service and Scheme Membership used by SuperVal can be
rounded in a number of different ways. Select from the drop-down list
one of the following options:

-   Exact Days
-   Months Rounded Down
-   Nearer Months
-   Months Rounded Up
-   Years Rounded Down
-   Nearer Years
-   Years Rounded Up
-   Complete Tax Years

The entry on the Membership Tab will be used unless an Override is
specified on a particular Slice. Note, service is rounded on a Slice by
Slice basis and there is no rounding for total service.
