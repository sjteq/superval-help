# Alternative Normal Retirement Age

This field allows an alternative retirement age to be specified for
discontinuance and withdrawal liabilities. It does not apply to the
retirement of actives.

Enter the NRA for discontinuance and withdrawal liabilities for
males/females. The Alternate NRA can be before or equal to the NRA
entered on the Membership Tab.
