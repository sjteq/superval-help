# GMP: Revaluation Type to SPA

Select from the drop-down list how to revalue the GMPs for members who
leave active service before SPA. The options are:

-   None
-   Fixed
-   Limited
-   S148

If `Fixed` Rate revaluations are selected SuperVal will use the
following rates to revalue the pension (based on member’s year of exit):

Leaving Service Date  | Revaluation Rate
----------------------|-----------------
Post-06/04/2012       | 4.75%
06/04/2007–05/04/2012 | 4.00%
06/04/2002–05/04/2007 | 4.50%
06/04/1997–05/04/2002 | 6.25%
06/04/1993–05/04/1997 | 7.00%
06/04/1988–05/04/1993 | 7.50%
Pre-06/04/1988        | 8.50%

If `Limited` is selected, then please note LRPs will not be calculated.
This option is intended to give the user an indication of the difference
between Fixed and Limited revaluations.

If `S148` increases are selected then enter the appropriate rate of
increase in the field [Section 148 orders](actives_basis+s148.md).
