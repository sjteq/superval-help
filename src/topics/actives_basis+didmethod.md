# Death in Deferment: Method

This and the other Cash Flow Parameters only affect the `Cash Flow
Summary` page in the Excel Output/Consolidation Output. This field is
only used to position the death in deferment results in the `Cash Flow
Summary` page. It does not have any effect on the Valuation Results.

Select from the drop-down list how to capitalise the Death in Deferment
benefits. The options are:

-   Tables
-   Default

If `Tables` is selected then you need to select the tables applicable
for the death in deferment Pension and Lump Sum in the following fields.
The tables should contain the age at which the death in deferment
liability is capitalised for age (nearest) at date of withdrawal.

If `Default` is selected then the death in deferment liability will be
capitalised at the assumed point of leaving service.
