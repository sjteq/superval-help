# PPF_Yields+PPFPENpiI

SuperVal shows you the net yield that will be used to value pensions
with increases in payment.

The yield will be calculated in accordance with the Guidance issued from
the PPF documented in Guidance Notes A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8 and A9 and
then adjusted by any entry in the Post Retirement (with increases)
Adjustment field.
