# Franking in Deferment

Check this box if you want to allow for franking in deferment. The GMP
benefits will not be added to the other PUPs but will be compared with
the total Excess pension at each age and the greater of the two benefits
valued. This enable the user to value PUPs that pre-date anti-franking
legislation.

The calculations will take account of any pre SPA increases, Barber
Adjustment and the Underpin before comparing the benefits.

The GMP payable on normal or early retirement before SPA may be
different from the GMP at SPA increased in line with statutory
requirements.
