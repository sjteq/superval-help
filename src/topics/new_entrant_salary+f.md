# Inflation on Previous Salary

Adoption of the Previous Salary for a New Entrant Salary investigation
would remove the possible effect of any promotional effects if Current
Salary were to be used.

If you have specified the Previous Salary field to be used, you are able
to inflate all the salaries to a common date, the End Date, by
specifying an Annual Inflation Rate to update Previous Salary.

If this is specified, Previous Salary will be assumed to be the salary
at entry to the Scheme and will be inflated for the period from the
entry date to the End Date.
