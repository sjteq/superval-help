# Lump Sum DIS Insured: Rate Loading

If the cost of insuring a particular group of people (i.e. those in
hazardous occupations) is higher a loading to the standard rates can be
made. Enter the amount of the loading here. The loading should be input
as a percentage i.e. to increase the rates by 20% enter a loading of 120%.
For no adjustment enter a 100%.

Note, the insured costing for the Lump Sum on Death in Service will be
costed per Â£1,000 per annum. Therefore, if this has not already been
taken account of in the premium rates (i.e. your premium rates are
simply `qx`) you will need a rate loading of 100 &times; 1000 % = 100,000%.
