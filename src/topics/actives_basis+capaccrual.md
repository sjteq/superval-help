# Uniform Cap Accrual

If you have opted to use Service Related Accrual, and opted to accrue
this using the Uniform method, then check this box if SuperVal should
spread the accrual of benefits over the period to Date of Exit. Leave
this box unchecked if SuperVal should accrue the additional benefits
over the remaining period of capped service.

If not using Service Related Accrual, and benefits are subject to a
service cap then check this box if the future service benefits are
accrued uniformly over the period to Date of Exit. Leave this box
unchecked if future service benefits are accrued over the remaining
period of capped service.
