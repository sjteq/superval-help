# Spouses DAR Override

The user has the option to enter an override for the [Spouseâ€™s Death
after Retirement Percentage](deferreds_basis+warfrac.md) entered on the
Ret Pension Tab.

Either enter the fixed percentage override or select from the drop-down
list the data item that contains the appropriate data for this PUP. If
the override is fixed for all members, enter as a percentage i.e. for 50%
enter `50` rather than `0.5`. (Note for Ind Pups only a fixed percentage can
be used.)

If you do not wish to use this option then leave blank.
