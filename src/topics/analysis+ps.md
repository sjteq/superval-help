# Upper Limit of Membership Ranges

Specify the membership or service ranges to be used in the analysis. The
values specified represent the upper limits of the ranges.

The first group will include all durations less than or equal to the
first value and data beyond the last limit specified will be grouped
into a final group.

Enter the (service) duration ranges as a vector, e.g. `10 20 30 40`.
