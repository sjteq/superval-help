# `bases+toxx`

This field is used to define the transfer-out decrement rate at each age (non-retirement ages). 
Decrement rates entered are assumed to be independent.
SuperVal will derive the dependent rates from these.

Double-click to select from an age-related transfer table (`TO` type).
To ignore transfers out, select the table `TO000 `which contains zero at all ages. 
The table description will be shown to the right of this field.

Members who transfer out are assumed to exit half-way through the year.
