# Salary Increase Rate

This is the annual rate at which salaries for all members will increase
to date of exit. A [Promotional Salary Scale](actives_basis+sxx.md) in
excess of general salary increases can be specified on the Salaries tab.

Select from the drop-down list the Global Financial Parameter that
contains the rate applicable. Once selected, the current value of the
Global Financial Parameter is shown to the right of this field.

To add a new Global Financial Parameter use the _Edit Scheme Financials_
button at the bottom of this tab.

This will be used in all salary definitions unless the [Salary Inflation
Rate Override](actives_basis+salinf.md) on the Salaries tab is
populated.
