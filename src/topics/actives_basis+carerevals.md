Check this box to revalue the CARE benefit accrued in the year of exit
immediately. Leave this box unchecked to revalue the CARE benefit
accrued in the year of exit in the following year only. Consider a
member with:

P = Accrued CARE Pension  
S = Salary over the year  
r = Revaluation Rate.

The accrual rate is 1/60.

If the box is checked to increase the accrued benefit immediately then
the benefit at the end of the year is calculated as (P + S/60) &times; (1+r)

If the box is unchecked then the benefit is calculated at the end of the
year as $P \times (1+r) + S/60$
