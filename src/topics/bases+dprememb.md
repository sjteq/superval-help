# Mortality: Data Field Loading

If a percentage loading adjustment to the mortality table is required on
a member-by-member basis, then select from the drop-down list the data
item containing the loading.

The data item selected should contain the percentage above 100%, so if
loading of 110% is required then use `10` or if a loading of 90% is
required then use `-10`.

Please note that if the [Mortality Rate Parameters](bases+dpre.md)
above include a percentage adjustment then this will also be applied to
the base table in addition to any entry in this field.
