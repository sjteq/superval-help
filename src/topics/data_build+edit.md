Click _Edit Source File_ button to open the CSV file containing the data
in Excel. Changes can then be made to the data if required.

Please note that if changes are made to the CSV file then these
amendments will not be shown in the original Excel file containing the
data. An alternative approach would be to edit the Excel file containing
the data and to re-load.
