# Revaluation Rate when BAGE&lt;SPA

This field only applies to normal/early retirement pensions before SPA.
It is not used for death in deferment benefits. If GMP retirement
benefits payable before SPA are determined using a different rate of
revaluation to that used to SPA then that different rate should be
entered here.

Select from the drop-down list the Global Financial Parameter that
contains the rate applicable. Once selected, the current value of the
Global Financial Parameter is shown to the right of this field.

To add a new Global Financial Parameter use the Edit Scheme Financials
button at the bottom of this Tab.

If this field is left blank, SuperVal will use the [Revaluation Rate to
SPA](pensioners_basis+gmprev1.md).
