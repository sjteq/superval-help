# Quick_Scenario+Ratepc

  
If amortisation is included within the consolidation file, the rate,
term or amount can be kept constant.  
The field chosen i.e. _First Year Contribution_, _Term_ or _Deficit /
(Surplus) Amortised_ is greyed out and then changing one of the
remaining two alters the other appropriately. For example:Â  if the term
is kept constant, the rate can then be adjusted and the deficit /
surplus amortised calculated.
