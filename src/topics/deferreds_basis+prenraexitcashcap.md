# Count Complete Years for the Cash Cap

The user has the option to enter an override for the [Count Complete
Years](deferreds_basis+revyrs.md) entered on the Financial Tab.

Exits before NRA such as early retirement and death in deferment are
assumed to occur half way through the year i.e. 0.5, 1.5, 2.5 years after
the valuation date. By selecting `Yes` these benefits will receive
revaluations for the number of complete years only i.e. 0, 1, 2. By
selecting `No` these benefits will receive an additional half-year of
revaluations i.e. 0.5, 1.5, 2.5.

If you do not wish to use this option then leave blank.
