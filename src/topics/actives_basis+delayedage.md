# Age Increases Commence

If [Delayed Increase in Payment](actives_basis+delayedpi.md) is
checked, enter the age pension increases will commence from. This field
only applies to Retirement Benefits (and not ill-health benefits).

For example, assume a pension of £100 is paid at age 65. If pension
increases had been granted the pension at 70 would be £130. The Age
Increases Commence is set to 70. The pension valued between age 65 and
70 will be £100. The pension valued at age 70 including the pension
increases that would have been paid between age 65 and 70 will be £130.
The pension from age 70 will increase in line with the pension increases
specified.

The pension cashflows (before applying probabilities), between age 65
and 70 would be £100 pa. From age 70 onwards, the pension cashflows
would be £130 pa, increasing in future years by the pension increases
assumption.
