# ASCII Files of all Modified Rate Tables

If checked, ASCII Files of all modified Rate Tables will be created and
stored in the Library Folder of SuperVal.

These files enable the transfer of Rate Tables into and out of other
software or into other Rate Table files (if any) used by SuperVal.

These files are produced whenever Rate Tables are saved after adding or
editing a Rate Table and are deleted (if they exist) when Rate Tables
are deleted.
