# The Add button

When a parent node of a group of Rate Tables is highlighted (and you
have been given the appropriate access level), an _Add_ button will become
enabled. This will also be used to add another Factor Table.

On pressing the _Add_ button, the Rate Table number, description and rates
can be specified.

Note that after the _Add_ button is pressed and until the addition is
completed or aborted, the Rate Table file is locked to stop other users
from making simultaneous changes to this Rate Table file (which may
cause corruption of the file). Thus it is recommended that the shortest
time possible be spent in this mode.
