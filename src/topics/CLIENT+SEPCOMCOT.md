Tick this field to split the cash between cash commutation, cash on top
and other cash (such as Death in Service cash) in the database. This
split will be available for Actives and Deferreds. Pensioners are
already broken down by Pension 1, Pension 2, etc so the cash split was
not applied to this module.

This is only available for Users with Extended Parameters (CC3) and open
database.
