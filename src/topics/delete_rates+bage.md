# Age/Duration Band

Specify the Age or Duration band of the rates to be deleted.

All values after those deleted are moved back to fill in the spaces left
by those values deleted and that table will be filled with default
values (zero for Age related tables and one for Duration related
tables).

Click the OK button to see the effect of the change on the table. The
user will be required to confirm they are happy with the changes before
the rate table is updated.
