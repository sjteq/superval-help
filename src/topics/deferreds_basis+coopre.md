# Ignore Pre-1988/Post-1988 GMP for Cash Benefits

Cash Commutation/Cash on Top is defined on the Ret Cash Tab and can be
either a Percentage or a Multiple of the PUP. Check these boxes if you
wish the Multiple or the Percentage to be based on the PUPs excluding
either the Pre-1988 GMP or the Post-1988 GMP amount. (Check both boxes
to exclude both.) Leave these boxes unchecked to include either the
Pre-1988 GMP or the Post-1988 GMP amount.

Please note that where either the Pre-1988 GMP or the Post-1988 GMP is
included, SuperVal will restrict any pension commuted to ensure that no
GMP is exchanged for cash.
