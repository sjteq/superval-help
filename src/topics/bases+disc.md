# Discounted Lump Sum

The field is used to specify whether the Lump Sum paid as a result of a
guarantee after death is discounted or undiscounted for Actives,
Deferreds and the Annuity Calculator.

Check this box to discount, with interest, the lump sum payable. Leave
this box unchecked if the lump sum payable is undiscounted.
