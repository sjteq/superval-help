# PPF Adjustment Factor

A negative or positive loading can be applied to the pension calculated
from this Tier of benefits on a PPF valuation. This loading can either
be fixed for all members or be a member specific amount.

For a fixed adjustment, enter the number as a multiplier i.e. `1.1` for a
10% increase or `0.9` for a 10% decrease. If no adjustment is required
enter `1`. If `0` is entered the liability for this Tier will be zero. To
value a negative pension based on the parameters on the Tier, enter `-1`.

For a member specific adjustment, select from the drop-down list the
data item containing the member specific adjustment factor.

The pension calculated in this Tier will be multiplied by the data item
entered in this field.
