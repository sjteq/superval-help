# PPF Yields: Post-2009 Pre Retirement Adjustment

SuperVal calculates the PPF yields in accordance with the Guidance
issued from the PPF and documented in Guidance Notes A3, A4, A5, A6 and
A7.

This field can be used to make adjustment to this calculation i.e. to
reflect Guidance prior to A3 or when new Guidance is issued.

Enter the adjustment that applies to the yield used for compensation
increasing in deferment and accrued after 5 April 2009. The adjustment
is additive i.e. if the calculated yield is 3.25% and `0.25` is entered, the
revised yield will be 3.50%.
