# Underpin Fund Increase Rate

For actives, the Underpin Comparison is made at the earlier of Death,
Withdrawal, Early and Normal Retirement. For deferreds, the Underpin
Comparison is made at the earlier of Death, Early and Normal Retirement.
This is the rate at which the underpin fund is increased while the
member remains in service/deferment.

Select from the drop-down list the Global Financial Parameter that
contains the rate applicable. Once selected, the current value is shown
to the right of this field.

To add a new Global Financial Parameter use the _Edit Scheme Financials_
button at the bottom of this tab.
