The following page shows the Data Format for the Non-Standard Data
Items.

These are broken down into "Total" Numerical Fields, "Average" Numerical
Fields, Character Fields and Date Fields.

Please note that when creating your data, any Non-Standard data items
will have included in the header row details of whether it is a
Character Field, a Numeric Field or a Date Field.  The Numeric Fields
can either be Totals or Averages and are distinguished by a capital "N"
for a total and a lower case "n" for an average field.  The user should
ensure that any salary, pension and accumulated contributions are shown
under the "Total" Numerical Fields and that any service fields, such as
added years, are shown under the "Average" Numerical Fields.
