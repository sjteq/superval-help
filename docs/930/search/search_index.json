To get around this you can amend the     Assumptions Summary, which will mitigate this limitation.</li> <li>Mortality Assumptions uses a \u201cbenefit weighted\u201d average Mortality at     each exit point (/contingency if separated). The same adjustment is     applied to all ages.</li> <li>Under Pensioners \u2013 Pensions Increases Only and Spouse\u2019s Only options     do not work in QSM.</li> <li>Only post-retirement mortality assumptions can be adjusted.</li> <li>GMP calculations involving franking use an approximate modelling     method in this version, due to the greater complexity.</li> <li>Benefits cannot be capitalised.</li> </ul> <p>We have tested the QSM over a wide range of benefit parameters but, with the range of basis parameters in SuperVal, it is unlikely that we have been able to test every possible combination of basis parameters.

Therefore we need to calculate the proportion (P) commuted which will lead to a lump sum of \u00a345,000:</p> <pre><code>P \u00d7 (10,000 \u00d7 10 + 10,000 \u00d7 15)  = 45,000\n</code></pre> <p>Therefore P = 18%.

The total cash is the same, but it\u2019s assumed only to be taken from excess over GMP pension. Therefore P will end up higher. For example, if GMP at retirement was \u00a34,000 in the above example, then then total excess is \u00a316,000 (\u00a36,000 PS and \u00a310,000 FS).</p> <pre><code>P \u00d7 (6,000 \u00d7 10 + 10,000 \u00d7 15) = 45,000\n</code></pre> <p>and so P = 21.43%. So </p> <pre><code>PS pension = 0.7857 \u00d7 6,000 + 4,000 =  \u00a38,712\nPS cash    = 0.2143 \u00d7 6,000 \u00d7 10    = \u00a312,858\n</code></pre> <p>And </p> <pre><code>FS pension                          =  \u00a37,857\nFS cash    = 0.2143 \u00d7 10,000 \u00d7 15   = \u00a332,145\n</code></pre> <p>If NRA&lt;SPA, SuperVal will also check that there is sufficient residual benefit at SPA to cover GMP - and limit the retirement cash   if necessary.)</p> <p>Note 3: Only member\u2019s pension will be commuted.
