Leave the box unchecked if service from this Slice should not be included in the comparison. SuperVal will limit the benefits if the total service from all of the Slices where this box is checked exceeds the Maximum Service specified on the Membership Tab. The service will be restricted at the point that it exceeds the maximum i.e. SuperVal will start at the largest Slice Number on which benefits are defined and work down to Slice 1 (the future service Slice). The benefits on the Slice where the Maximum Service is exceeded will be reduced. All Slices with a lower number will have a zero liability. Revaluation in Deferment This is the rate at which the benefits from this Slice will increases in deferment i.e. between date of leaving active service and NRA. Select from the drop-down list which of the 3 revaluation rates previously defined should be used.

Check this box if the benefit from this Slice should be included in the comparison against the Underpin benefit. Leave this box unchecked if the benefits from this Slice should not be included in the comparison against the Underpin benefit. Benefit Basis Select from the drop-down list whether the benefits described on this Slice are a Final Salary benefit or Career Average Revalued Earnings (CARE) benefit. If Final Salary is selected then the benefit calculated from this Slice will increase in line with salary increases until retirement or earlier exit. The salary increase used will be taken from the Salary Increase Rate on the Financial Tab unless this has been overridden by the Salary Increase Override field on the Salary Tab. If CARE is selected then the benefit calculated from this Slice will increase in line with the CARE Revaluation Rate on the Financial tab. Note that for past service CARE Slices the pension amount as at the Valuation Date is needed and should be entered as a Fixed Pension in Tiers 1, 2 or 3. ERF Tables ERF/LRF Tables Select from the drop-down list which of the Early/Late Retirement Factor Tables to apply to the benefit arising from this Benefit Slice.

If checked, the user will have the option to check the Tier 3 Benefits Defined Box to define a third Tier of benefits. The benefits defined on either the second or third Tier can be added. Alternatively, the user has the option to subtracted a previous Tier from the final Tier of benefits defined i.e. Tier 1 or the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 can be deducted from Tier 3, or Tier 1 can be deducted from Tier 2. Male PPF NRA (Levy Valuations) Female PPF NRA (Levy Valuations) On the Legislation Tab, enter the NRA to be attached to the GMP, which is converted in to excess pension, for PPF valuations. Elsewhere, for Actives and Deferreds, select from the drop-down list which of the previously defined PPF NRAs applies to the pension or benefit slice. The PPF NRAs are specified on the PPF/Cap Tab. For Pensioners enter the normal retirement age to be used as the PPF NRA in the PPF (S179 Levy) Valuation. The PPF NRAs are only used to determine the level of capping required. They do not override the Benefit Commencing Age. To allow for ill health retirements, use a sufficiently low age so that all members exceed this age i.e. 16. To allow for early retirement pensions, use an age such as 50. PPF Service Period PPF guidance, requires the user to show separately the Pre-1997 pension, post 6 April 1997 to 5 April 2009 pension and the Post 6 April 2009 pension. Select from the drop-down list whether the pension is: Pre-97 97 to 09 Post-09 Salary Select from the drop-down list which of the salaries defined on the Salary Tab to use in the calculation of benefits from this Tier/Slice. Leave this field blank to enable the Fixed Pension field where a fixed pension benefit can be valued. Accrual Rate Multiplier Accrual Rate Divisor Accrual Rate [Data Item] Enter both the numerator and the denominator for the rate of accrual where this is the same for all members for this Benefit Slice i.e. for 1/60th accrual enter 1 in the numerator and 60 in the denominator. If the accrual rate varies by member, then leave these two fields blank and this will enable you to enter an Accrual Rate Data Item instead. Select from the drop-down list the data item containing the Member Specific Accrual Rate. The data item should contain the Accrual Rate as a percentage i.e. for 1/60th use 0.01667 . (This might be used when each member has a targeted benefit of 2/3rds over their career but receive a pro-rata amount on earlier exit. The Member Specific Accrual Rate Calculator can be used to calculate such a data item.) The benefit from the Tier will be calculated as the accrual rate (numerator/denominator) times Salary times service. The service would be the period specified on the Benefit Slice, or Accelerated Service Table , or Added Years . When using Accelerated Service Tables or Service Related Accrual Tables , enter the underlying Accrual Rate that applies to all service here. Either the Accelerated Service Table or the Service Related Accrual Table will contain the number of years of the underlying Accrual Rate at each duration. To enter a Fixed Pension, ensure both these and the Salary field above are blank. Accrual Rate Table If the accrual rate varies by age or service then this field can be used instead of Accrual Rate or the Accrual Rate Data Item . Accrual varies by duration of service If the accrual rate varies by service, then the table entered is indexed by the service period defined on the Benefit Slice. Double click to select an HT type table that contains the cumulative Accrual Rate Table. (Note the service defined on the slice is only used to reference the table and not in the Benefit Calculations.) For example, if the accrual rate was 80ths for the first 10 years service and then 60ths thereafter, the table would have 0.1250 at duration 10 (10 \u00d7 1/80) and 0.1417 at duration 11 (10/80 + 1/60). Accrual Varies by age If the accrual rate varies by age, then the table entered is indexed by the member\u2019s age. Double click to select an HX type table that contains the Accrual Rate for each age. The rate at the members age will then be multiplied by the service period defined for the Benefit Slice. For example, if the accrual rate was 80ths before age 40 and 60ths thereafter, the table would hold the value 0.0125 at each age below 40 and 0.0167 at each age above 40. Please note that the Accrual Rate Table can only be applied to service in a single Slice and cannot be applied across Benefit Slices (or Tiers). To value different Accrual Rates across different Slices then consider using the Service Related Accrual Table . Some functionality only available to some users. Accelerated Service Table If the service granted for each year of accrual is greater than actual service then this field can be used to determine the service credit. Double click to select an ET type table containing the cumulative service credit that will be indexed by the period of service defined on the Benefit Slice. The corresponding value in the ET table will be used in the Benefit Calculations. (Part years will be linearly interpolated.) For example, a member receives an additional 5 years pensionable service on completion of 10 years. The ET table would have an entry of 9 at duration 9 and 15 at duration 10, 16 at 11 etc. The Accelerated Service Table should not be used with a maximum service restriction but instead the maximum service should be contained within the Table used. Please note that the Accelerated Service Table can only be applied to service in a single Slice and cannot be applied across Benefit Slices (or Tiers). To value different Accrual Rates across different Slices then consider using the Service Related Accrual Table . Some functionality is only available to some users. Service Related Accrual Table This is ET , FT , GT and HT type rate tables, which is indexed by the period of service specified by the Benefit Slice. It is the corresponding entry on the ET , FT , GT and HT table that is used in the benefit calculation. The service period is calculated from DOE Qualifying Service to the start date/end date on the slice. SuperVal will then linearly interpolate to obtain the value for the member\u2019s exact period of service. Typical uses for this table may be uplifted service or extra years of service granted after a certain period. For example, suppose that members receive a further 5 years pensionable service on completion of 10 years. The Service Related Accrual Table would have an entry of 9 at duration 9 and 15 at duration 10, 16 at 11 etc. i.e. the table is cumulative. Please note that the Service Related Accrual Table will be applied across Benefit Slices (or Tiers). If a ET , FT , GT and HT table is not defined, then the service will be the period between the Start Date (or minimum start date) and Finish Date (or maximum finish date) for the Benefit Slice. Allowance would be made for maximum service. Double click to select from the list of available ET , FT , GT and HT type rate tables. When using this field, you will be required to enter the date from which service starts to accrue in the DOE Qualifying Service on the Membership Tab. Not all functionality is available to all users. Fixed Pension [Data Item] Select from the drop-down list the data item containing the Fixed Pension Amount. This might have arisen from either a transfer-in or a past service CARE benefit. Increase in Service If the Benefit Basis is CARE, then this pension amount will be increased in service at the CARE Revaluation Rate . If the Benefit Basis is Final Salary, then this pension amount will not be increased in service. (To value a fixed pension that increases in line with salaries, instead consider defining a salary equal to the pension amount and setting up a Slice with an accrual rate of 1/1 multiplied one year of service. Increase in Deferment This pension amount will be increased in deferment at the Revaluation in Deferment Rate specified on the Slices Tab. (The rate chosen will impact on the Early-Retirement Factors that are used.) Note: A Pension Data Item and benefit accrual can be specified in the same Slice as long as they are on different Tiers. Alternatively they can be specified on different Slices. Minimum Pension This field can be used to define a minimum amount of pension that will be provided from this Tier of the particular Slice. This can either be fixed for all members of be member specific. Either enter the amount of the minimum pension or select from the drop-down list the data item containing the member specific data. The amount entered will not be increased by SuperVal between the valuation date and the point of exit ie retirement, withdrawal, death. If no minimum applies then leave this field blank. Maximum Pension This field can be used to define a maximum amount of pension that that will be provided from this Tier of the particular Slice. This can either be fixed for all members of be member specific. Either enter the amount of the maximum pension or select from the drop-down list the data item containing the member specific data. The amount entered will not be increased by SuperVal between the valuation date and the point of exit ie retirement, withdrawal or death. If no maximum applies then leave this field blank. Pension Adjustment Factor A negative or positive loading can be applied to the pension calculated from this Tier of benefits. This loading can either be fixed for all members or be a member specific amount. For a fixed adjustment, enter the number as a multiplier i.e. 1.1 for a 10% increase or 0.9 for a 10% decrease. If no adjustment is required enter 1 . If 0 is entered the liability for this Tier will be zero. To value a negative pension based on the parameters on the Tier, enter -1 . For a member specific adjustment, select from the drop-down list the data item containing the member specific adjustment factor. The pension calculated in this Tier will be multiplied by the data item entered in this field. Male PPF Adjustment Factor Female PPF Adjustment Factor A negative or positive loading can be applied to the pension calculated from this Tier of benefits on a PPF valuation. This loading can either be fixed for all members or be a member specific amount. For a fixed adjustment, enter the number as a multiplier i.e. 1.1 for a 10% increase or 0.9 for a 10% decrease. If no adjustment is required enter 1 . If 0 is entered the liability for this Tier will be zero. To value a negative pension based on the parameters on the Tier, enter -1 . For a member specific adjustment, select from the drop-down list the data item containing the member specific adjustment factor. The pension calculated in this Tier will be multiplied by the data item entered in this field. Deduct Tier 1 Deduct Tier 2 You can deduct the benefits calculated on Tier 1 from either of the benefit calculated on Tier 2 or Tier 3. In Tier 3 you can also deduct the sum of benefits calculated in Tiers 1 and 2. Check these boxes to determine which of the Tiers are deducted. Typical use of this field is for a greater-of benefit comparison. For example, suppose a scheme provides a benefit which is the greater of \\frac{Service \\times Salary}{80} \\frac{Service \\times Salary}{80} and \\frac{Service \\times (Salary - LEL)}{60} \\frac{Service \\times (Salary - LEL)}{60} . Two salaries have been defined in the Salary Tab i.e. Salary1 is Salary with no deduction and Salary2 is Salary with a LEL deduction. The benefits on Tier 1 will be set up to define the 1/80ths benefit. The benefits on Tier 2 will be set up to define the excess of the 1/60th benefit over the 1/80th benefit where this is greater than 0. Specify the 1/60th benefit on Tier 2 then check the box to deduct Tier 1. Also ensure that the Minimum Pension specified is zero. (This will ensure the excess is only valued where greater than zero.) The total benefit valued by the Tiers will be: 1/80ths + Max (1/60ths \u2013 1/80ths, 0) multiplied by the respective salaries and service.

The options are: Neutral or Nil 25% of Pension IR Maximum 2.25 \u00d7 Pension Accrual \u00d7 Salary for each year 3 \u00d7 Pension Multiple of Pension % of Pension When using the IR Maximum option the user will need to set up the IR Maximum Parameters Rules . When using the Accrual \u00d7 Salary for each year , the user will be required to enter the salary, service and accrual rate on which this is based. Note that if using this option, ERF factors will not be applied to the cash on top lump sum. (If you do want ERFs to be applied to cash on top, you could use the Multiple of pension option instead.) When using the Multiple of Pension , the Multiple can either be fixed for all members or be a member specific amount. To use a fixed Multiple, enter the value. To use a Member Specific Multiple, select from the drop-down list the data item containing the appropriate data. When using the % of Pension , the Percentage can either be fixed for all members or be a member specific amount. To use a fixed Percentage, enter the value. To use a Member Specific Percentage, select from the drop-down list the data item containing the appropriate data. When using 25% of Pension or % of Pension , the amount of cash lump sum will be determined by the Commutation Tables specified. For all of these options you can select whether to Ignore GMP in Split. The Commutation will be restricted to avoid commuting the GMP, however there is no allowance for post-retirement increases in calculating this restriction. In addition, you will be required to specify the Commutation Priority and the Commutation Tables to use. Finally, where benefits for both Cash On Top of pension and Cash Commutation are specified the Cash Commutation is calculated first. If the Cash On Top formula relates to the amount of pension this will be based on the pension prior to commutation. On Top or Commuted Select from the drop-down list which of the cash option to use. The options are: On Top Commuted If Commuted is selected, the amount of pension commuted will be restricted to the excess over GMP and then the user will be able to select the Commutation Priority . Accrual Rate This field is only required if the Cash Calculations are based on Accrual \u00d7 Salary for each year . Enter the percentage of salary to be used in the calculation of cash for each year of service i.e. for 3/80ths use 0.0375 . When using this option, Early-Retirement Factors will not be applied to the cash-on-top benefit. Salary This field is only required if the Cash Calculations are based on Accrual \u00d7 Salary for each year .

When using this option, Early-Retirement Factors will not be applied to the cash-on-top benefit. Cash Multiple This field is only required if the Cash Calculations are based on a Multiple of Pension . The Multiple can either be fixed for all members or member specific. To use a fixed multiple, enter the multiple here. (Using a multiple of 3 is the same as selecting 3 &times; pension .) To value a member specific multiple, select from the drop-down list the data item containing the appropriate data. Cash Percentage This field is only required if the Cash Calculations are based on a % of Pension . The Percentage can either be fixed for all members or a member specific percentage. To value a fixed percentage for all members, enter the percentage here ie for 25% enter 0.25 . To value a member-specific percentage, select from the drop-down list the data item containing the appropriate data. Include Prospective Service This field allows the user to specify whether the commuted cash or cash on top calculations will include the ill health prospective service when the Ill Health Benefit Basis is either a Prospective Pension or a Prospective Table. Check the box to include prospective service. Leave the box unchecked to exclude prospective service. Separate A-Day Cash Factors for each Pension Increase This field indicates if separate A Day cash factors are to be calculated for each pension increase or whether a single factor applies to the entire pension. If a User opts for the average factor approach which means the field is left unchecked, then the User needs to select whether the average factor will be applied Pro Rata or Priority. Treat Independent Slice Cash as Cash on Top Users sometimes value Cash on Top in the Ind Slices and Ind PUPs giving data items the same payment start and end age. If the intention is to include this Cash on Top amount in the A Day max calculation, then this box should be checked. If this box is unchecked the system will still value cash amounts in the Ind Slices and Ind PUPs but the A Day maximum will not be reduced to allow for this Cash on Top (if the basis has Percentage of A Day Cash commutation specified). Commutation Priority This field is used to determine the order in which pension will be commuted for cash. Select from the drop-down list which of the options to use. The options are: After Split (actives only) Before Split (actives only) Priority Pro Rata If After Split or Before Split is used then the pension is commuted by reference to the Latest Finish Date specified on the Offset Slice . Typically an active member will have a service timeline as shown in the following diagram: If After Split is selected then the pension accrued after the End of the Offset Slice would be commuted first. Within each period pension may increase at different rates and are commuted in the following order: Special Main Pension Increase 3 Pension Increase 4 If Before Split is selected then the pension accrued before End of the Offset Slice would be commuted first. Within each period pension may increase at different rates and are commuted in the following order: Special Main Pension Increase 3 Pension Increase 4 If Priority is selected then the cash is commuted according to the pension increase rate applied on the Slices or PUP Tab. Pensions are commuted in the following order: Special Main Pension Increase 3 Pension Increase 4 If Pro Rata is selected, then pension is commuted in proportion to the pension amounts, irrespective of the pension increase rate. Ignore GMP in Split This field enables the split between Pre-97 and Post-97 benefit to be done in the correct proportions. Check this box if SuperVal should ignore the GMP when calculating cash proportions. Please note that if this option is chosen then the GMP pension maybe commuted. (This depends on the options chosen and the size of the GMP.) However, SuperVal will still pay the whole of the GMP at SPA. This may overstate the liability. Male Reduction Factors Female Reduction Factors Ill Health Cash on Top Reduction Factors This field allows the user to specify a set of early retirement reduction factors that apply to Ill Health Cash-on-Top benefit. Typically, where this is unreduced the factors would be 1 at all ages. Double click to select from the list of available tables. If the field is left blank then SuperVal will assume 1 at all ages. If the Ill Health Cash-on-Top benefit is defined as Accrual \u00d7 Salary for each year of service then no Early-Retirement Factors can be applied. Related Selecting rate tables Decr Help Rate tables can be selected by any of the following methods: Right-click on the field for a list of appropriate Rate Tables. For a field that will accept more than one type of Rate Table (e.g. Miscellaneous Tables), the list will be restricted to the current Table Type specified in the field \u2013 if you wish to see all allowable Rate Tables, delete the Table Type from the field before clicking; or Double Clicking on the field will produce the Rate Tables form where Rate Tables can be viewed (numerically and graphically) and Rate Tables can be added or edited.

Linearly Interpolate Reduction Factors for mid-point Exit values Linearly Interpolate Male Commutation Tables for mid-point Exit values Linearly Interpolate Female Commutation Tables for mid-point Exit values When checked, the system will linearly interpolate factors for mid year exits such as early retirements and deaths. For Normal Retirements, the system will apply no interpolation. If unchecked, the system will use the factor specified at the age nearest rounded down for mid year exits as previous versions have done. Male Ill-Health Commutation Tables Parameter Set Female Ill-Health Commutation Tables Parameter Set Commutation Tables Parameter Set is a Scheme Global parameter which groups the Male or Female Commutation table variables. This can be created by using either the Create Globals function or using the Add/Edit Commutation Table button. Once created, these parameters can be edited without going back into the Basis similar to other global parameter sets. Calculate Male Commutation Factors based on Valuation Basis Calculate Female Commutation Factors based on Valuation Basis SuperVal will calculate commutation factors applicable to each individual member using the valuation basis and the all relevant Basis Parameters (Guarantee Period, Post Retirement Mortality, Post Retirement Interest rate and Pension Increases). Male % of Valuation Basis Factor Female % of Valuation Basis Factor Users can define the % of Valuation Basis Factor they want to apply to the Scheme. To have this field visible the above field Calculate Male/Female Commutation Factors based on Valuation Basis needs to be ticked. The Valuation Factors produced by SuperVal can be seen in individual VARPRINTs. Male Main Male Special Male PenInc3 Male PenInc4 Female Main Female Special Female PenInc3 Female PenInc4 Double click to select the rate table containing the Commutation Factors ie the amount of cash received for each pound per annum of pension commuted. For example, a factor of 9 at age 65 means that for every pound surrendered in pension at age 65 the member would receive \u00a39 in cash. Separate tables can be specified for males and females and for each of the different pension increase rates (Main, Special, Pension Increase 3 and Pension Increase 4) being used. NB: Even if cash is payable on top of pension benefits, cash commutation factors are still required for application of IR Maximum rules. Related Selecting rate tables Adjust Male Commutation Tables by the change in member's expectation of life Adjust Female Commutation Tables by the change in member's expectation of life Future mortality-improvement assumptions underlying the Technical Provisions can be applied to the tabulated commutation factors in force at the valuation date, to calculate revised commutation factors at the date of exit.

Select from the drop-down list which of the following options to use: FAS Projected Unit For CC3 users the selection on the Death Pen Tab will be used for both pension and cash benefits paid on death. The FAS option values the full prospective element whenever the member is assumed to exit, then spreads this over the period from Spreading Start Date to Spreading Finish Date . For normal FAS values, Spreading Start Date should be set to DJF and Spreading Finish Date to LDATE. The Projected Unit option values the full prospective element for those who exit within the control period only. For those who do not exit during the control period, only the benefit based on accrued service is valued. Spreading dates are ignored. For attained age valuations, SuperVal values the full prospective element for all future exits, i.e. the control period is infinite. Not all options are available to all users.

Elsewhere, for Actives and Deferreds, select from the drop-down list which of the previously defined PPF NRAs applies to the pension or benefit slice. The PPF NRAs are specified on the PPF/Cap Tab. For Pensioners enter the normal retirement age to be used as the PPF NRA in the PPF (S179 Levy) Valuation. The PPF NRAs are only used to determine the level of capping required. They do not override the Benefit Commencing Age. To allow for ill health retirements, use a sufficiently low age so that all members exceed this age i.e. 16. To allow for early retirement pensions, use an age such as 50. PPF Service Period PPF guidance, requires the user to show separately the Pre-1997 pension, post 6 April 1997 to 5 April 2009 pension and the Post 6 April 2009 pension. Select from the drop-down list whether the pension is: Pre-97 97 to 09 Post-09 Salary Select from the drop-down list which of the salaries defined on the Salary Tab to use in the calculation of benefits from this Tier/Slice. Leave this field blank to enable the Fixed Pension field where a fixed pension benefit can be valued. Accrual Rate Multiplier Accrual Rate Divisor Accrual Rate [Data Item] Enter both the numerator and the denominator for the rate of accrual where this is the same for all members for this Benefit Slice i.e. for 1/60th accrual enter 1 in the numerator and 60 in the denominator. If the accrual rate varies by member, then leave these two fields blank and this will enable you to enter an Accrual Rate Data Item instead. Select from the drop-down list the data item containing the Member Specific Accrual Rate. The data item should contain the Accrual Rate as a percentage i.e. for 1/60th use 0.01667 . (This might be used when each member has a targeted benefit of 2/3rds over their career but receive a pro-rata amount on earlier exit. The Member Specific Accrual Rate Calculator can be used to calculate such a data item.) The benefit from the Tier will be calculated as the accrual rate (numerator/denominator) times Salary times service. The service would be the period specified on the Benefit Slice, or Accelerated Service Table , or Added Years . When using Accelerated Service Tables or Service Related Accrual Tables , enter the underlying Accrual Rate that applies to all service here. Either the Accelerated Service Table or the Service Related Accrual Table will contain the number of years of the underlying Accrual Rate at each duration. To enter a Fixed Pension, ensure both these and the Salary field above are blank. Accrual Rate Table If the accrual rate varies by age or service then this field can be used instead of Accrual Rate or the Accrual Rate Data Item . Accrual varies by duration of service If the accrual rate varies by service, then the table entered is indexed by the service period defined on the Benefit Slice. Double click to select an HT type table that contains the cumulative Accrual Rate Table. (Note the service defined on the slice is only used to reference the table and not in the Benefit Calculations.) For example, if the accrual rate was 80ths for the first 10 years service and then 60ths thereafter, the table would have 0.1250 at duration 10 (10 \u00d7 1/80) and 0.1417 at duration 11 (10/80 + 1/60). Accrual Varies by age If the accrual rate varies by age, then the table entered is indexed by the member\u2019s age. Double click to select an HX type table that contains the Accrual Rate for each age. The rate at the members age will then be multiplied by the service period defined for the Benefit Slice. For example, if the accrual rate was 80ths before age 40 and 60ths thereafter, the table would hold the value 0.0125 at each age below 40 and 0.0167 at each age above 40. Please note that the Accrual Rate Table can only be applied to service in a single Slice and cannot be applied across Benefit Slices (or Tiers). To value different Accrual Rates across different Slices then consider using the Service Related Accrual Table . Some functionality only available to some users. Accelerated Service Table If the service granted for each year of accrual is greater than actual service then this field can be used to determine the service credit. Double click to select an ET type table containing the cumulative service credit that will be indexed by the period of service defined on the Benefit Slice. The corresponding value in the ET table will be used in the Benefit Calculations. (Part years will be linearly interpolated.) For example, a member receives an additional 5 years pensionable service on completion of 10 years. The ET table would have an entry of 9 at duration 9 and 15 at duration 10, 16 at 11 etc. The Accelerated Service Table should not be used with a maximum service restriction but instead the maximum service should be contained within the Table used. Please note that the Accelerated Service Table can only be applied to service in a single Slice and cannot be applied across Benefit Slices (or Tiers). To value different Accrual Rates across different Slices then consider using the Service Related Accrual Table . Some functionality is only available to some users. Fixed Pension [Data Item] Select from the drop-down list the data item containing the Fixed Pension Amount. This might have arisen from either a transfer-in or a past service CARE benefit. Increase in Service If the Benefit Basis is CARE, then this pension amount will be increased in service at the CARE Revaluation Rate . If the Benefit Basis is Final Salary, then this pension amount will not be increased in service. (To value a fixed pension that increases in line with salaries, instead consider defining a salary equal to the pension amount and setting up a Slice with an accrual rate of 1/1 multiplied one year of service. Increase in Deferment This pension amount will be increased in deferment at the Revaluation in Deferment Rate specified on the Slices Tab. (The rate chosen will impact on the Early-Retirement Factors that are used.) Note: A Pension Data Item and benefit accrual can be specified in the same Slice as long as they are on different Tiers. Alternatively they can be specified on different Slices. Minimum Pension This field can be used to define a minimum amount of pension that will be provided from this Tier of the particular Slice. This can either be fixed for all members of be member specific. Either enter the amount of the minimum pension or select from the drop-down list the data item containing the member specific data. The amount entered will not be increased by SuperVal between the valuation date and the point of exit ie retirement, withdrawal, death. If no minimum applies then leave this field blank. Maximum Pension This field can be used to define a maximum amount of pension that that will be provided from this Tier of the particular Slice. This can either be fixed for all members of be member specific. Either enter the amount of the maximum pension or select from the drop-down list the data item containing the member specific data. The amount entered will not be increased by SuperVal between the valuation date and the point of exit ie retirement, withdrawal or death. If no maximum applies then leave this field blank. Pension Adjustment Factor A negative or positive loading can be applied to the pension calculated from this Tier of benefits. This loading can either be fixed for all members or be a member specific amount. For a fixed adjustment, enter the number as a multiplier i.e. 1.1 for a 10% increase or 0.9 for a 10% decrease. If no adjustment is required enter 1 . If 0 is entered the liability for this Tier will be zero. To value a negative pension based on the parameters on the Tier, enter -1 . For a member specific adjustment, select from the drop-down list the data item containing the member specific adjustment factor. The pension calculated in this Tier will be multiplied by the data item entered in this field. Male PPF Adjustment Factor Female PPF Adjustment Factor A negative or positive loading can be applied to the pension calculated from this Tier of benefits on a PPF valuation. This loading can either be fixed for all members or be a member specific amount. For a fixed adjustment, enter the number as a multiplier i.e. 1.1 for a 10% increase or 0.9 for a 10% decrease. If no adjustment is required enter 1 . If 0 is entered the liability for this Tier will be zero. To value a negative pension based on the parameters on the Tier, enter -1 . For a member specific adjustment, select from the drop-down list the data item containing the member specific adjustment factor. The pension calculated in this Tier will be multiplied by the data item entered in this field. Deduct Tier 1 Deduct Tier 2 You can deduct the benefits calculated on Tier 1 from either of the benefit calculated on Tier 2 or Tier 3. In Tier 3 you can also deduct the sum of benefits calculated in Tiers 1 and 2. Check these boxes to determine which of the Tiers are deducted. Typical use of this field is for a greater-of benefit comparison.

Then at SPA it will make an addition for all the statutory revaluations on the GMP not yet in payment (subject to the Franking Code ). Revaluation Rate to NRA<SPA This is the rate at which GMP benefits will be revalued to NRA if the Revalue to NRA<SPA box has been checked. At SPA, SuperVal will revalue the GMP using the Revaluation Type to SPA selected. Any shortfall in revaluations (when compared to the GMP at NRA) will be added to the PUP at SPA. The addition at SPA would be subject to the Franking Code . Select from the drop-down list the Global Financial Parameter that contains the rate applicable. Once selected the current value of the Global Financial Parameter is shown to the right of this field. To add a new Global Financial Parameter use the Edit Scheme Financials button at the bottom of this Tab. An example to illustrate this is set out below: Suppose you have a male member who is currently 30 who will retire at age 60. All of his pension is revalued in deferment at 3.5% pa. The user has checked the Revalue to NRA<SPA box and has selected a Global Financial Parameter with a value of 3.5% for this field. The GMP revaluation type is fixed. The pension accrued in the 2nd year is \u00a31,000 of which \u00a3500 is GMP. Once in payment, the pension will increase at 4% per annum. The deferred PUP payable at age 60, after leaving in the second year, will be calculated as \u00a31,000 \\times 1.035^{28} = \u00a32,620 \u00a31,000 \\times 1.035^{28} = \u00a32,620 (Note that GMP is revalued using complete years in the same way as the excess over GMP.) The addition at SPA for GMP revaluations not yet in payment, assuming no franking, is calculated as \u00a3500 \\times 1.045^{32} - \u00a3500 \\times 1.035^{28} = \u00a3735 \u00a3500 \\times 1.045^{32} - \u00a3500 \\times 1.035^{28} = \u00a3735 (Note that complete tax years are used for the revaluation of the GMP to SPA.) The deferred PUP at SPA will be calculated as \u00a32,620 \\times 1.04^5 + \u00a3735 = \u00a33,923 \u00a32,620 \\times 1.04^5 + \u00a3735 = \u00a33,923 Franking Code For Actives and Deferred Members, there are five choices for Franking of GMPs for members retiring before SPA. For Pensioners only the first three options are available. Select from the drop-down list which of these to apply. The options are: None Partial Franking Full Franking Maximum Franking No Anti Franking Guarantee An example to illustrate how these different options work is set out below: Suppose you have a male member retiring at 60 with a pension as follows: Pension = \u00a32,000 GMP at 60 = \u00a31,000 (included in above figure) GMP at 65 = \u00a31,500 GMP revaluations between 60 and 65 are therefore \u00a3500 (\u00a31,500 less \u00a31,000). Once in payment, the pension will increase at 5% per annum. The additional pension at SPA for the GMP revaluations between 60 and 65 under each of the options are as follows: None All of the revaluations on the GMP are added to the pension at SPA. So, the pension at 65 is calculated as \u00a32,000 \\times 1.05^5 + \u00a3500 = \u00a33,053 \u00a32,000 \\times 1.05^5 + \u00a3500 = \u00a33,053 Partial Franking Revaluations on the GMP between retirement and SPA, less scheme increases granted on the GMP, are added to the pension at SPA. So, the pension at 65 is calculated as \u00a32,000 \\times 1.05^5 + \\left[ 500 \u2013 1,000 \\times \\left( 1.05^5 \u2013 1 \\right) \\right] = \u00a32,776 \u00a32,000 \\times 1.05^5 + \\left[ 500 \u2013 1,000 \\times \\left( 1.05^5 \u2013 1 \\right) \\right] = \u00a32,776 Note that the difference between the GMP revaluations and scheme increases on the GMP can not be used to reduce the pension payable ie the item in square brackets cannot be negative. Full Franking All of the increases on the pension between retirement and SPA are franked against revaluation on the GMP. So, the pension at 65 is calculated as \u00a32,000 \\times 1.05^5 + \\left[ 500 - 2,000 \\times \\left( 1.05^5 \u2013 1 \\right) \\right] = \u00a32,553 \u00a32,000 \\times 1.05^5 + \\left[ 500 - 2,000 \\times \\left( 1.05^5 \u2013 1 \\right) \\right] = \u00a32,553 Note that the difference between the GMP revaluations and scheme increases on the whole pension can not be used to reduce the pension payable i.e. the item in square brackets cannot be negative. Maximum This option differs from Full Franking only if you have an early retirement decrement in your basis. For the early retirements the calculation assumes there is No Anti-Franking guarantee. So the pension at 65 is calculated as \u00a32,000 \\times 1.05^5 = \u00a32,553 \u00a32,000 \\times 1.05^5 = \u00a32,553 For the normal retirement the calculation assumes Full Franking. So the pension at 65 is calculated as \u00a32,000 \\times 1.05^5 + \\left[ 500 \u2013 2,000 \\times \\left( 1.05^5 \u2013 1 \\right) \\right] = \u00a32,553 \u00a32,000 \\times 1.05^5 + \\left[ 500 \u2013 2,000 \\times \\left( 1.05^5 \u2013 1 \\right) \\right] = \u00a32,553 Note that the difference between the GMP revaluations and scheme increases on the whole pension can not be used to reduce the pension payable i.e. the item in square brackets cannot be negative. No Anti Franking Guarantee No antifranking guarantee is made at SPA. So, the pension at 65 is calculated as \u00a32,000 \\times 1.05^5 = \u00a32,553 \u00a32,000 \\times 1.05^5 = \u00a32,553 Offset Slices Offset Slice Number This field is used to identify the date at which the GMP accrual ceased. Enter the Slice Number on which the Service Finish Date should be used as the date at which GMP accrual has ceased. All of the benefits arising from the Slice entered and higher Slice Numbers will be assumed to have an underlying GMP benefit. (Including those Slices where only added years and pension data item benefits are specified.) For example, if there are four Slices specified as follows: slice specification 1 Future Service, i.e. VDATE to LDATE 2 Service from 6/4/1997 (or DJF if later) to VDATE 3 Service from a benefit/category change date (or DJF if later) to 6/4/1997 4 Service from DJF to the benefit/category change date The Offset Slice Number entered is 3, meaning that the benefits under Slices 3 and 4 will have GMP underlying them. The benefits under Slices 1 and 2 will not have GMP benefits. Where the Scheme is Contracted-In and/or GMP benefits are payable on top of the benefits entered on the Slices, enter a value of 17 . Please note that this field is used in a Non PPF Capped Valuation Run to determine which parts of the pension receive pension increases. Pension arising from Slices before the Offset Slice number and higher will be deemed to have no pension increases for PPF Valuation purposes. Pension arising from a Slice number lower than the Offset Slice will be deemed to be increasing pension in payment for PPF Valuation purposes. Statutory GMP Increases to NRA>SPA This field determines the pension increases that are used to increase the GMP between SPA and NRA for retirements after SPA. Check the box to increase GMPs by 1/7% per week, then by the assumed statutory GMP increases from SPA to NRA.

The Date Joined Company (DJS) is used in the calculation of the maximum. The Post-A-Day Tax Simplification Rules are not calculated by SuperVal. However, there is an option to use either a percentage or multiple data item for the cash benefit percentage which could be manipulated to approximate this benefit. Cap Increase Rate Inland Revenue Limits for joiners Post-31/05/1989 are calculated using the Earnings Cap. This is the rate at which the Earnings Cap will increase to date of exit. Select from the drop-down list the Global Financial Parameter that contains the rate applicable. Once selected, the current value of the Global Financial Parameter is shown to the right of this field. To add a new Global Financial Parameter use the Edit Scheme Financials button at the bottom of this Tab. The Earnings Cap, to which this rate is applied, is taken from the Factor File. The Factor that contains the Earnings Cap is called Max. Please note that the calculations determine the total benefit amount for Post-1989 joiners using the Earnings Cap figure but do not restrict the actual salary used in the calculations to the Earnings Cap. In order to limit the salary used to the Earnings Cap set a Salary Maximum on the Salaries Tab. Salary Select from the drop-down list which of the salaries defined on the Salaries Tab should be used to calculate the Inland Revenue maximum pension. Application Select from the drop-down list how to apply the Inland Revenue Maximum Rules to the retirement and cash benefits.

If the Payment Frequency is monthly, the first pension increase will be awarded halfway through the month in which pension increases become payable (or the review date if specified). If the Payment Frequency is annual, first year increases are only granted if the review date falls in the first six months after the valuation date. The increase granted will reflect the period from the review date to the mid-year. First year increases are not granted if the review date falls in the second part of the first year. Subsequent increases are valued in full on the anniversary of the commencement of benefit. (This was the only method available prior to V8.50.) If \"None\" is selected, no pension increase is valued at the first review date or opportunity to pay pension increases following benefit commencement.

They do not have any effect on the Valuation Results. Select from the drop-down list the option to use. The options are: Capitalise Spread If Capitalise is selected the output will show the cashflows assuming the benefits are capitalised at the point of first payment. If Spread is selected the output will show the cashflows as they become due. However, the Death in Deferment Liability shown will always be the capitalised value of the payments. The user can choose the point at which the Death in Deferment Liability is shown in the Cash Flows summary in the Death in Deferment Method field. In addition, if Spread is chosen for Actives or Deferreds, the user will be required to specify at which point the Underpin Liability is capitalised in the Underpin Method . When running a DAB method valuation, this field must be set to Capitalise. Death in Deferment Method This and the other Cash Flow Parameters only affect the Cash Flow Summary page in the Excel Output/Consolidation Output. This field is only used to position the death in deferment results in the Cash Flow Summary page. It does not have any effect on the Valuation Results. Select from the drop-down list how to capitalise the Death in Deferment benefits. The options are: Tables Default If Tables is selected then you need to select the tables applicable for the death in deferment Pension and Lump Sum in the following fields. The tables should contain the age at which the death in deferment liability is capitalised for age (nearest) at date of withdrawal. If Default is selected then the death in deferment liability will be capitalised at the assumed point of leaving service. Pension Age This field is only used to position the results in the Cash Flow Summary page in the Excel/Consolidation Output. It does not have any effect on the Valuation Results. If you have selected Tables for the Death in Deferment Method then double click to select the rate table containing the age at which you want the Death in Deferment Pension Liability to be capitalised in the Cash Flow Summary. The table will be indexed by age nearest at start of the year of death. For example, a Table assuming the liability will be capitalised 2/3rds of the way to retirement at age 65 would have entries as follows between 35 and 45: Age at Start of the Year of Leaving Age DID Pension Capitalised Value Shown 35 55 36 55 37 56 38 56 39 56 40 57 41 57 42 57 43 58 44 58 45 58 The figure appearing in the Cash Flow Summary Listing will be the capitalised Death in Deferment Pension liability rolled forward with interest.

Related Selecting rate tables Decr Help Rate tables can be selected by any of the following methods: Right-click on the field for a list of appropriate Rate Tables. For a field that will accept more than one type of Rate Table (e.g. Miscellaneous Tables), the list will be restricted to the current Table Type specified in the field \u2013 if you wish to see all allowable Rate Tables, delete the Table Type from the field before clicking; or Double Clicking on the field will produce the Rate Tables form where Rate Tables can be viewed (numerically and graphically) and Rate Tables can be added or edited. A Rate Table can be selected by pressing the Select button or double clicking on the Rate Table description in the tree; or the list of allowable Rate Tables can be scrolled through by pressing the < or > keys. The description of the Rate Table to the right of the field will change as each new Table is selected. Lump Sum Age This field is only used to position the results in the Cash Flow Summary page in the Excel/Consolidation Output. It does not have any effect on the Valuation Results. If you have selected Tables for the Death in Deferment Method then double click to select the rate table containing the age at which you want the Death in Deferment Lump Sum Liability to be capitalised in the Cash Flow Summary. The table will be indexed by age nearest at start of the year of death. For example, a Table assuming the 2/3rds rule with NRA 65 would have entries as follows: Age at Start of the Year of Leaving Age DID Lump Sum Capitalised Value Shown 35 55 36 55 37 56 38 56 39 56 40 57 41 57 42 57 43 58 44 58 45 58 \u2026 \u2026 The figure appearing in the Cash Flow Summary Listing will be the capitalised Death in Deferment Lump Sum liability rolled forward with interest.

The options are: Tables Default If Tables is selected then enter the rate tables applicable on the events where the Underpin is taking place. These are: Retirement - actives and deferreds Leaving Age - actives Death in Deferment - deferreds If Default is selected then the Underpin (excess) liability will be capitalised at the payment start point. Retirement Age This and the following fields affect the Cash Flow Summary page in the Excel/Consolidation Output only. They do not have any effect on the Valuation Results. If you have selected Tables for the field Pension Benefits Capitalised or Spread then select a rate table containing the age at which you want the Underpin (excess) liability on Retirement to appear in the Cash Flow. The table will be indexed by age nearest at start of the year of retirement. Typically tables entered here would be of EX type.

Select from the drop-down list one of the following options: Ignore Maximum Minimum Scale down If Ignore is selected then the Alternate Slices are ignored and only the (normal) Benefit Slices will be valued. If Maximum is selected then the benefits arising at exit from Benefit Slices and Alternate Slices are compared and the greater is valued. If Minimum is selected then the benefit arising at exit from Benefit Slices and Alternate Slices are compared and the lower is valued. If Scale Down is selected then the benefits arising at exit from Benefit Slices and Alternate Slices are compared. If the benefits on the Alternate Slices are smaller than the benefits from the Benefit Slices then the benefit on the Normal Slices is scaled down in proportion.

When \u2018Uniform\u2019 is selected the benefits are spread proportionately between past and future service assuming that accrual in each year is at the average rate of accrual for the member over their total service. For example, in certain schemes where there is \u2018double accrual\u2019 after 20 years, the past service liability will take account of any future period with double accrual that may apply to their benefits even if they have not yet reached the point where double accrual begins. The user will then have the option to Cap the accrued service using Uniform Cap Accrual . When Non-Uniform is selected the benefits are not spread proportionately. Under this option, using the example above, the past service liability only takes account of any double accrual that has actually taken place up to the valuation date Consider a scheme where the accrual is 1/60 th up to 20 years and 1/30 th thereafter. The only decrement is retirement which occurs after 30 years of actual service. In SuperVal, the accrual rate will be set to 1/60 th and the Service Related Accrual Table will contain the number of 60 ths the member receives at each duration. At 30 years this will be 40. A member currently has 10 years of service. Under uniform accrual their past service will be \\frac{10}{30} \\times 40 = 13.3 \\frac{10}{30} \\times 40 = 13.3 years or \\frac{13.33}{40} = 33\\% \\frac{13.33}{40} = 33\\% of total liability Under non-uniform accrual their past service will be 10 years or \\frac{10}{40} = 25\\% \\frac{10}{40} = 25\\% of total liability Consider the same scheme but with a member who has 25 years of service. Under uniform accrual their past service will be \\frac{25}{30} \\times 40 = 33.3 \\frac{25}{30} \\times 40 = 33.3 years or \\frac{33.33}{40} = \\83% \\frac{33.33}{40} = \\83% of total liability Under non-uniform accrual their past service will be (20 + 2 \\times 5) = 30 (20 + 2 \\times 5) = 30 years or \\frac{30}{40} = 75\\% \\frac{30}{40} = 75\\% of total liability Uniform Cap Accrual If you have opted to use Service Related Accrual, and opted to accrue this using the Uniform method, then check this box if SuperVal should spread the accrual of benefits over the period to Date of Exit. Leave this box unchecked if SuperVal should accrue the additional benefits over the remaining period of capped service.

This is an NS type table which contains the New Entrant Salaries at each age. Note that the New Entrant Salary Rate Table is assumed to be an annual salary for a new entrant and therefore could be different to the frequency specified in the data format. The level of salary entered will be relevant where there are fixed deductions, maximums or minimums to the benefits i.e. Basic State Pension, LEL or Earnings Cap. Related Selecting rate tables Decr Help Rate tables can be selected by any of the following methods: Right-click on the field for a list of appropriate Rate Tables. For a field that will accept more than one type of Rate Table (e.g. Miscellaneous Tables), the list will be restricted to the current Table Type specified in the field \u2013 if you wish to see all allowable Rate Tables, delete the Table Type from the field before clicking; or Double Clicking on the field will produce the Rate Tables form where Rate Tables can be viewed (numerically and graphically) and Rate Tables can be added or edited. A Rate Table can be selected by pressing the Select button or double clicking on the Rate Table description in the tree; or the list of allowable Rate Tables can be scrolled through by pressing the < or > keys. The description of the Rate Table to the right of the field will change as each new Table is selected. Age Rating Any Rate Table can be rated up or down by a number of years as required to make the rate at every age lighter or heavier than in the original table. A value of +10 will result, for example, in the value selected for a 30 year old actually being the rate for a 40 year old and for a value of -5 would mean that the value at age 25 is selected. If an age rating of a fraction of a year is required, a new table will have to be created through the Edit rate table option on the Rate Table form. % Rating A percentage adjustment can be made to either a Rate Table or a Salary. The Rate Tables can be adjusted by a percentage loading to make the decrement rate lighter or heavier than the original table. The salary for new entrants can be loaded to reflect changes in the salary profile. Enter the number as percentage above 100% i.e. if a loading of 110% is required then enter 10 or if a loading of 90% then enter -10 . If no adjustment is required then leave blank. Value Specify the value of the Numeric Data Default that should be used for the new entrants in the New Entrants Runs. The user should specify the absolute value and the number of decimal places to use. If you wish to consider a member specific value for each member then contact a member of the SuperVal support team for more information. Decimal Places In order to get the correct precision, you must specify the number of decimal places to be displayed. An input data field such as a Benefit Multiple will require a few decimal places but an accumulation of contributions will be accurate enough if rounded to the nearest pound. The Data File created will contain the values entered into the Value field rounded to this number of decimal places. Type The type field is a display only field reminding you of the type of the numeric data item. The distinction is only relevant for the New Entrant Model Replacement when multiple members are assumed in the New Entrant Proportions. The New Entrant Data Default for a Total Numeric non-standard data field will be multiplied by the number of members whereas the Average Numeric non-standard data field will not. An example of a Total Numeric non-standard data field might be a salary source item (as the total salary for the group of members is assumed) whereas an example of an Average non-standard data field might be an additional contribution rate (where the same rate applies irrespective of the number of members).

This can be created by using either the Create Globals function or using the Add/Edit Retirement Cash button. Once created, these parameters can be edited without going back into the Basis similar to other global parameter sets. Benefit Basis A lump sum cash benefit can be paid at retirement either through commutation (ie exchange of pension for cash) or in addition to the pension benefits. Select from the drop-down list the basis of calculating any cash benefit provided. The options are: Neutral or Nil 25% of Pension IR Maximum 2.25 \u00d7 Pension Accrual \u00d7 Salary for each year 3 \u00d7 Pension Multiple of Pension % of Pension When using the IR Maximum option the user will need to set up the IR Maximum Parameters Rules . When using the Accrual \u00d7 Salary for each year , the user will be required to enter the salary, service and accrual rate on which this is based. Note that if using this option, ERF factors will not be applied to the cash on top lump sum. (If you do want ERFs to be applied to cash on top, you could use the Multiple of pension option instead.) When using the Multiple of Pension , the Multiple can either be fixed for all members or be a member specific amount. To use a fixed Multiple, enter the value. To use a Member Specific Multiple, select from the drop-down list the data item containing the appropriate data. When using the % of Pension , the Percentage can either be fixed for all members or be a member specific amount. To use a fixed Percentage, enter the value. To use a Member Specific Percentage, select from the drop-down list the data item containing the appropriate data. When using 25% of Pension or % of Pension , the amount of cash lump sum will be determined by the Commutation Tables specified. For all of these options you can select whether to Ignore GMP in Split. The Commutation will be restricted to avoid commuting the GMP, however there is no allowance for post-retirement increases in calculating this restriction. In addition, you will be required to specify the Commutation Priority and the Commutation Tables to use. Finally, where benefits for both Cash On Top of pension and Cash Commutation are specified the Cash Commutation is calculated first. If the Cash On Top formula relates to the amount of pension this will be based on the pension prior to commutation. On Top or Commuted Select from the drop-down list which of the cash option to use. The options are: On Top Commuted If Commuted is selected, the amount of pension commuted will be restricted to the excess over GMP and then the user will be able to select the Commutation Priority . Accrual Rate This field is only required if the Cash Calculations are based on Accrual \u00d7 Salary for each year . Enter the percentage of salary to be used in the calculation of cash for each year of service i.e. for 3/80ths use 0.0375 . When using this option, Early-Retirement Factors will not be applied to the cash-on-top benefit. Salary This field is only required if the Cash Calculations are based on Accrual \u00d7 Salary for each year . Select from the drop-down list the salary to be used in the calculation of cash for each year of service. When using this option, Early-Retirement Factors will not be applied to the cash-on-top benefit. Service This field is only required if the Cash Calculations are based on Accrual \u00d7 Salary for each year . Select from the drop-down list the service to be used in the calculation of cash for each year of service. The options are: Scheme Membership Company Service Note that total service from either Date Joined Scheme or Date Joined Company will be used in these calculations. When using this option, Early-Retirement Factors will not be applied to the cash-on-top benefit. Cash Multiple This field is only required if the Cash Calculations are based on a Multiple of Pension . The Multiple can either be fixed for all members or member specific. To use a fixed multiple, enter the multiple here. (Using a multiple of 3 is the same as selecting 3 &times; pension .) To value a member specific multiple, select from the drop-down list the data item containing the appropriate data. Cash Percentage This field is only required if the Cash Calculations are based on a % of Pension . The Percentage can either be fixed for all members or a member specific percentage. To value a fixed percentage for all members, enter the percentage here ie for 25% enter 0.25 . To value a member-specific percentage, select from the drop-down list the data item containing the appropriate data. Separate A-Day Cash Factors for each Pension Increase This field indicates if separate A Day cash factors are to be calculated for each pension increase or whether a single factor applies to the entire pension. If a User opts for the average factor approach which means the field is left unchecked, then the User needs to select whether the average factor will be applied Pro Rata or Priority. Treat Independent Slice Cash as Cash on Top Users sometimes value Cash on Top in the Ind Slices and Ind PUPs giving data items the same payment start and end age. If the intention is to include this Cash on Top amount in the A Day max calculation, then this box should be checked. If this box is unchecked the system will still value cash amounts in the Ind Slices and Ind PUPs but the A Day maximum will not be reduced to allow for this Cash on Top (if the basis has Percentage of A Day Cash commutation specified). Commutation Priority This field is used to determine the order in which pension will be commuted for cash. Select from the drop-down list which of the options to use. The options are: After Split (actives only) Before Split (actives only) Priority Pro Rata If After Split or Before Split is used then the pension is commuted by reference to the Latest Finish Date specified on the Offset Slice . Typically an active member will have a service timeline as shown in the following diagram: If After Split is selected then the pension accrued after the End of the Offset Slice would be commuted first. Within each period pension may increase at different rates and are commuted in the following order: Special Main Pension Increase 3 Pension Increase 4 If Before Split is selected then the pension accrued before End of the Offset Slice would be commuted first. Within each period pension may increase at different rates and are commuted in the following order: Special Main Pension Increase 3 Pension Increase 4 If Priority is selected then the cash is commuted according to the pension increase rate applied on the Slices or PUP Tab. Pensions are commuted in the following order: Special Main Pension Increase 3 Pension Increase 4 If Pro Rata is selected, then pension is commuted in proportion to the pension amounts, irrespective of the pension increase rate. Ignore GMP in Split This field enables the split between Pre-97 and Post-97 benefit to be done in the correct proportions. Check this box if SuperVal should ignore the GMP when calculating cash proportions. Please note that if this option is chosen then the GMP pension maybe commuted. (This depends on the options chosen and the size of the GMP.) However, SuperVal will still pay the whole of the GMP at SPA. This may overstate the liability. Male Commutation Tables Parameter Set Female Commutation Tables Parameter Set Commutation Tables Parameter Set is a Scheme Global parameter which groups the Male or Female Commutation table variables. This can be created by using either the Create Globals function or using the Add/Edit Commutation Table button. Once created, these parameters can be edited without going back into the Basis similar to other global parameter sets. Calculate Male Commutation Factors based on Valuation Basis Calculate Female Commutation Factors based on Valuation Basis SuperVal will calculate commutation factors applicable to each individual member using the valuation basis and the all relevant Basis Parameters (Guarantee Period, Post Retirement Mortality, Post Retirement Interest rate and Pension Increases). Male % of Valuation Basis Factor Female % of Valuation Basis Factor Users can define the % of Valuation Basis Factor they want to apply to the Scheme. To have this field visible the above field Calculate Male/Female Commutation Factors based on Valuation Basis needs to be ticked. The Valuation Factors produced by SuperVal can be seen in individual VARPRINTs. Male Main Male Special Male PenInc3 Male PenInc4 Female Main Female Special Female PenInc3 Female PenInc4 Double click to select the rate table containing the Commutation Factors ie the amount of cash received for each pound per annum of pension commuted. Please note that SuperVal assumes exits prior to NRA occur half-way through the year i.e. 0.5 years, 1.5 years etc after the valuation date. Exits at NRA occur at the beginning of the year. This should be reflected in the Commutation Factors entered into the table ie for ages prior to NRA the factor in the table should be the factor that would apply at the point of exit. For example, a factor of 9 at age 65 means that for every pound surrendered in pension at age 65 the member would receive \u00a39 in cash. Separate tables can be specified for males and females and for each of the different pension increase rates (Main, Special, Pension Increase 3 and Pension Increase 4) being used. Even if cash is payable on top of pension benefits, cash commutation factors are still required for application of IR Maximum rules. Related Selecting rate tables Decr Help Rate tables can be selected by any of the following methods: Right-click on the field for a list of appropriate Rate Tables. For a field that will accept more than one type of Rate Table (e.g. Miscellaneous Tables), the list will be restricted to the current Table Type specified in the field \u2013 if you wish to see all allowable Rate Tables, delete the Table Type from the field before clicking; or Double Clicking on the field will produce the Rate Tables form where Rate Tables can be viewed (numerically and graphically) and Rate Tables can be added or edited. A Rate Table can be selected by pressing the Select button or double clicking on the Rate Table description in the tree; or the list of allowable Rate Tables can be scrolled through by pressing the < or > keys. The description of the Rate Table to the right of the field will change as each new Table is selected. Linearly Interpolate Male Commutation Tables for mid-point Exit values Linearly Interpolate Female Commutation Tables for mid-point Exit values When checked, the system will linearly interpolate factors for mid year exits such as early retirements and deaths. For Normal Retirements, the system will apply no interpolation. If unchecked, the system will use the factor specified at the age nearest rounded down for mid year exits as previous versions have done. Adjust Male Commutation Tables by the change in member's expectation of life Adjust Female Commutation Tables by the change in member's expectation of life Future mortality-improvement assumptions underlying the Technical Provisions can be applied to the tabulated commutation factors in force at the valuation date, to calculate revised commutation factors at the date of exit.

The user can specify 4 different sets of Early-Retirement Factors (actives) and 2 different sets of Early-Retirement Factors (deferreds). For actives these are: ERF1 for use with Revaluation Rates in deferments 1 and 3 ERF1 for use with Revaluation Rate 2 ERF2 for use with Revaluation Rates in deferment 1 and 3 ERF2 for use with Revaluation Rate 2 For deferreds these are ERF1 ERF2 Users without Late Retirement Tab The rate table is typically an FX table and should contain non-zero entries for ages at which members are assumed to retire. Please note that SuperVal assumes exits prior to NRA occur half-way through the year ie 0.5 years, 1.5 years etc after the valuation date. Exits at NRA occur at the beginning of the year. This should be reflected in the early retirement reduction factor tables used. Therefore, if the reduction is 4% simple per annum, and the NRA is 65, the table should be defined as follows: Age Rate 65 1.00 64 0.98 63 0.94 62 0.90 Etc. Benefits of members above NRA can be adjusted to reflect late payment by adding a factor in ages above NRA i.e. 1.04 at age 66 for a 4% increase. Please note members above NRA will be assumed to retire at the valuation date. Where this has been left blank, SuperVal will assume an Early-Retirement Factor of 1.

Linearly Interpolate Male Retirement Factors for mid-point Exit values Linearly Interpolate Female Retirement Factors for mid-point Exit values When checked, the system will linearly interpolate factors for mid year exits such as early retirements and deaths. For Normal Retirements, the system will apply no interpolation. If unchecked, the system will use the factor specified at the age nearest rounded down for mid year exits as previous versions have done. Delayed Increases in Payment Check this box to value delayed Pension Increases for members. Leave this box unchecked if Pension Increases are payable from retirement. This field is only available to some users. Age Increases Commence If Delayed Increase in Payment is checked, enter the age pension increases will commence from. This field only applies to Retirement Benefits (and not ill-health benefits). For example, assume a pension of \u00a3100 is paid at age 65. If pension increases had been granted the pension at 70 would be \u00a3130. The Age Increases Commence is set to 70. The pension valued between age 65 and 70 will be \u00a3100. The pension valued at age 70 including the pension increases that would have been paid between age 65 and 70 will be \u00a3130. The pension from age 70 will increase in line with the pension increases specified. The pension cashflows (before applying probabilities), between age 65 and 70 would be \u00a3100 pa. From age 70 onwards, the pension cashflows would be \u00a3130 pa, increasing in future years by the pension increases assumption. This field is only available to some users.

The multiplier could be set to 1.04 if salary increases were at 8% p.a. Male Promotional Scale Table Female Promotional Scale Table Promotional salary scales are salary increases that are provided in addition to the general salary increases previously specified. Double click to select from either an age related promotional salary scale ( S Type) or a service related promotional salary scale ( ST Type). For both types, the table will contain the year on year rates (and not cumulative rates). When using a service related promotional scale the user will be required to input the date from which service will be calculated in the Date for Durational Decrements field on the Demographic Tab. General salary increases are normally specified in the Salary Increase field on the Financial Tab. Alternatively, for a particular salary definition this can be overridden by the Salary Increase Override on the Salaries Tab. Some options are only available to some users. Timing of Salary Increases Select from the drop-down list the timing of salary increases. The options are: Review Date Continuous Weighted If Review Date is selected, salaries will be updated on the date entered in Review Date. If Continuous is selected, salaries will be increased continuously. If Weighted is selected, salaries will be updated on the date entered in Review Date but weighted when calculating Final Average Salary. The projection of Salary is the same for both Review Date and Weighted. The difference relates to the calculation of Final Average Salary. Under Review Date, Final Average Salary is the average salary as at the last N review dates. Under Weighted, Final Average Salary is the average salary over the last N years. Hence, Review Date can be used to model Final Average Salaries that only increase once a year on the Review Date whereas Weighted is used to model Final Average Salaries that increase continuously during the year. For more information on how these different salaries are calculated please see the Infocus Document relating to Salary Projections in SuperVal. Review Date If Salary Increase Timing was either Review Date or Weighted then enter the date salaries increase in the form DD/MM. Averaging Period Enter the number of years over which salaries are averaged either on leaving or at retirement. Averaging Ceases Select from the drop-down list when the salary averaging should be applied. The options are: On Leaving Service At NRD Under On Leaving Service the salary averaging will be applied on all decrements. Under At NRD the salary averaging will only be applied on exit at Normal Retirement Date. Initial Final Average Salary Select from the drop-down list the data item containing the initial Final Average Salary. This will be used as Final Average Salary as at the valuation date and blended with projected final average salary calculated using Current Salary and Salary Inflation to produce Final Average Salary during the specified averaging period. If left blank, Final Average Salary as at the valuation date will be calculated using Current Salary deflated using the Salary Inflation rate specified. More information on the application of this field can be found in the Infocus Document relating to Salary Projections. Last Salary in Average Check this box if the last salary should be included in the final average salary calculation. Leave unchecked to exclude the last salary in the final average salary calculations. If checked, SuperVal will average the salary over the averaging period specified. If unchecked, SuperVal will add 2 years to the averaging period specified. Deduction Initial Value Enter the amount of salary deduction you wish to apply. This can either be a fixed amount for all members or a member specific amount. To use a fixed value across all members, enter the value here. To use a member specific value, select from the drop-down list the appropriate data item. For example, if the pensionable salary definition is reduced by the Lower Earnings Limit, enter the Lower Earnings Limit as at the valuation date in this field. If both a maximum and a deduction are used, then the maximum is applied before the deduction i.e. entering a maximum of Upper Earnings Limit and deduction of a Lower Earnings Limit would give Band Earnings. Deduction Adjustment Factor This field allows the user to adjust the deduction by a fixed factor. It might be used where the data used for the deduction is out of date and needs to be increased to take account of an extra part year of inflation. Enter the number as a multiplier, e.g. 1.1 for a 10% increase or 0.9 for a 10% decrease. For no adjustment enter a value of 1 . This field can also be used to add the deduction amount on to the salary. To do this ensure the value entered is negative i.e. -1 to add the deduction, without adjustment, onto the salary. Deduction Increase Rate Override This the rate at which the deduction will be increased. Select from the drop-down list the Global Financial Parameter that contains the rate applicable. Once selected, the current value of the Global Financial Parameter is shown to the right of this field. To add a new Global Financial Parameter use the Edit Scheme Financials button at the bottom of this tab. If the Deduction is non-increasing select a Global Financial Parameter set to 0. If this field is left blank, SuperVal will use the Salary Overall Parameters Increase Rate specified on the Financial tab. Maximum Initial Value Enter the amount of salary maximum you wish to apply. This can either be a fixed amount for all members or a member specific amount. To use a fixed value across all members, enter the value here. To use a member specific value, select from the drop-down list the appropriate data item. For example, if the pensionable salary definition is restricted by the Earnings Cap, then enter the Earnings Cap as at the valuation date in this field. If both a maximum and a deduction are used, then the maximum is applied before the deduction i.e. entering a maximum of Upper Earnings Limit and deduction of a Lower Earnings Limit would give Band Earnings. Maximum Adjustment Factor This field allows the user to adjust the maximum by a fixed factor. It might be used where the data used for the maximum is out of date and needs to be increased to take account of an extra part year of inflation. Enter the number as a multiplier, e.g. 1.1 for a 10% increase or 0.9 for a 10% decrease. For no adjustment enter a value of 1 . Maximum Increase Rate Override This the rate at which the maximum will be increased. Select from the drop-down list the Global Financial Parameter that contains the rate applicable. Once selected, the current value of the Global Financial Parameter is shown to the right of this field.

The projection of Salary is the same for both Review Date and Weighted. The difference relates to the calculation of Final Average Salary. Under Review Date, Final Average Salary is the average salary as at the last N review dates. Under Weighted, Final Average Salary is the average salary over the last N years. Hence, Review Date can be used to model Final Average Salaries that only increase once a year on the Review Date whereas Weighted is used to model Final Average Salaries that increase continuously during the year.

Elsewhere, for Actives and Deferreds, select from the drop-down list which of the previously defined PPF NRAs applies to the pension or benefit slice. The PPF NRAs are specified on the PPF/Cap Tab. For Pensioners enter the normal retirement age to be used as the PPF NRA in the PPF (S179 Levy) Valuation. The PPF NRAs are only used to determine the level of capping required. They do not override the Benefit Commencing Age. To allow for ill health retirements, use a sufficiently low age so that all members exceed this age i.e. 16. To allow for early retirement pensions, use an age such as 50. PPF Service Period PPF guidance, requires the user to show separately the Pre-1997 pension, post 6 April 1997 to 5 April 2009 pension and the Post 6 April 2009 pension. Select from the drop-down list whether the pension is: Pre-97 97 to 09 Post-09 Salary Select from the drop-down list which of the salaries defined on the Salary Tab to use in the calculation of benefits from this Tier/Slice. Leave this field blank to enable the Fixed Pension field where a fixed pension benefit can be valued. Accrual Rate Multiplier Accrual Rate Divisor Accrual Rate [Data Item] Enter both the numerator and the denominator for the rate of accrual where this is the same for all members for this Benefit Slice i.e. for 1/60th accrual enter 1 in the numerator and 60 in the denominator. If the accrual rate varies by member, then leave these two fields blank and this will enable you to enter an Accrual Rate Data Item instead. Select from the drop-down list the data item containing the Member Specific Accrual Rate. The data item should contain the Accrual Rate as a percentage i.e. for 1/60th use 0.01667 . (This might be used when each member has a targeted benefit of 2/3rds over their career but receive a pro-rata amount on earlier exit. The Member Specific Accrual Rate Calculator can be used to calculate such a data item.) The benefit from the Tier will be calculated as the accrual rate (numerator/denominator) times Salary times service. The service would be the period specified on the Benefit Slice, or Accelerated Service Table , or Added Years . When using Accelerated Service Tables or Service Related Accrual Tables , enter the underlying Accrual Rate that applies to all service here. Either the Accelerated Service Table or the Service Related Accrual Table will contain the number of years of the underlying Accrual Rate at each duration. To enter a Fixed Pension, ensure both these and the Salary field above are blank. Accrual Rate Table If the accrual rate varies by age or service then this field can be used instead of Accrual Rate or the Accrual Rate Data Item . Accrual varies by duration of service If the accrual rate varies by service, then the table entered is indexed by the service period defined on the Benefit Slice. Double click to select an HT type table that contains the cumulative Accrual Rate Table. (Note the service defined on the slice is only used to reference the table and not in the Benefit Calculations.) For example, if the accrual rate was 80ths for the first 10 years service and then 60ths thereafter, the table would have 0.1250 at duration 10 (10 \u00d7 1/80) and 0.1417 at duration 11 (10/80 + 1/60). Accrual Varies by age If the accrual rate varies by age, then the table entered is indexed by the member\u2019s age. Double click to select an HX type table that contains the Accrual Rate for each age. The rate at the members age will then be multiplied by the service period defined for the Benefit Slice. For example, if the accrual rate was 80ths before age 40 and 60ths thereafter, the table would hold the value 0.0125 at each age below 40 and 0.0167 at each age above 40. Please note that the Accrual Rate Table can only be applied to service in a single Slice and cannot be applied across Benefit Slices (or Tiers). To value different Accrual Rates across different Slices then consider using the Service Related Accrual Table . Some functionality only available to some users. Accelerated Service Table If the service granted for each year of accrual is greater than actual service then this field can be used to determine the service credit. Double click to select an ET type table containing the cumulative service credit that will be indexed by the period of service defined on the Benefit Slice. The corresponding value in the ET table will be used in the Benefit Calculations. (Part years will be linearly interpolated.) For example, a member receives an additional 5 years pensionable service on completion of 10 years. The ET table would have an entry of 9 at duration 9 and 15 at duration 10, 16 at 11 etc. The Accelerated Service Table should not be used with a maximum service restriction but instead the maximum service should be contained within the Table used. Please note that the Accelerated Service Table can only be applied to service in a single Slice and cannot be applied across Benefit Slices (or Tiers). To value different Accrual Rates across different Slices then consider using the Service Related Accrual Table . Some functionality is only available to some users. Service Related Accrual Table This is ET , FT , GT and HT type rate tables, which is indexed by the period of service specified by the Benefit Slice. It is the corresponding entry on the ET , FT , GT and HT table that is used in the benefit calculation. The service period is calculated from DOE Qualifying Service to the start date/end date on the slice. SuperVal will then linearly interpolate to obtain the value for the member\u2019s exact period of service. Typical uses for this table may be uplifted service or extra years of service granted after a certain period. For example, suppose that members receive a further 5 years pensionable service on completion of 10 years. The Service Related Accrual Table would have an entry of 9 at duration 9 and 15 at duration 10, 16 at 11 etc. i.e. the table is cumulative. Please note that the Service Related Accrual Table will be applied across Benefit Slices (or Tiers). If a ET , FT , GT and HT table is not defined, then the service will be the period between the Start Date (or minimum start date) and Finish Date (or maximum finish date) for the Benefit Slice. Allowance would be made for maximum service. Double click to select from the list of available ET , FT , GT and HT type rate tables. When using this field, you will be required to enter the date from which service starts to accrue in the DOE Qualifying Service on the Membership Tab. Not all functionality is available to all users. Fixed Pension [Data Item] Select from the drop-down list the data item containing the Fixed Pension Amount. This might have arisen from either a transfer-in or a past service CARE benefit. Increase in Service If the Benefit Basis is CARE, then this pension amount will be increased in service at the CARE Revaluation Rate . If the Benefit Basis is Final Salary, then this pension amount will not be increased in service. (To value a fixed pension that increases in line with salaries, instead consider defining a salary equal to the pension amount and setting up a Slice with an accrual rate of 1/1 multiplied one year of service. Increase in Deferment This pension amount will be increased in deferment at the Revaluation in Deferment Rate specified on the Slices Tab. (The rate chosen will impact on the Early-Retirement Factors that are used.) Note: A Pension Data Item and benefit accrual can be specified in the same Slice as long as they are on different Tiers. Alternatively they can be specified on different Slices. Minimum Pension This field can be used to define a minimum amount of pension that will be provided from this Tier of the particular Slice. This can either be fixed for all members of be member specific. Either enter the amount of the minimum pension or select from the drop-down list the data item containing the member specific data. The amount entered will not be increased by SuperVal between the valuation date and the point of exit ie retirement, withdrawal, death. If no minimum applies then leave this field blank. Maximum Pension This field can be used to define a maximum amount of pension that that will be provided from this Tier of the particular Slice. This can either be fixed for all members of be member specific. Either enter the amount of the maximum pension or select from the drop-down list the data item containing the member specific data. The amount entered will not be increased by SuperVal between the valuation date and the point of exit ie retirement, withdrawal or death. If no maximum applies then leave this field blank. Pension Adjustment Factor A negative or positive loading can be applied to the pension calculated from this Tier of benefits. This loading can either be fixed for all members or be a member specific amount. For a fixed adjustment, enter the number as a multiplier i.e. 1.1 for a 10% increase or 0.9 for a 10% decrease. If no adjustment is required enter 1 . If 0 is entered the liability for this Tier will be zero. To value a negative pension based on the parameters on the Tier, enter -1 . For a member specific adjustment, select from the drop-down list the data item containing the member specific adjustment factor. The pension calculated in this Tier will be multiplied by the data item entered in this field. Male PPF Adjustment Factor Female PPF Adjustment Factor A negative or positive loading can be applied to the pension calculated from this Tier of benefits on a PPF valuation. This loading can either be fixed for all members or be a member specific amount. For a fixed adjustment, enter the number as a multiplier i.e. 1.1 for a 10% increase or 0.9 for a 10% decrease. If no adjustment is required enter 1 . If 0 is entered the liability for this Tier will be zero. To value a negative pension based on the parameters on the Tier, enter -1 . For a member specific adjustment, select from the drop-down list the data item containing the member specific adjustment factor. The pension calculated in this Tier will be multiplied by the data item entered in this field. Deduct Tier 1 Deduct Tier 2 You can deduct the benefits calculated on Tier 1 from either of the benefit calculated on Tier 2 or Tier 3. In Tier 3 you can also deduct the sum of benefits calculated in Tiers 1 and 2. Check these boxes to determine which of the Tiers are deducted. Typical use of this field is for a greater-of benefit comparison. For example, suppose a scheme provides a benefit which is the greater of \\frac{Service \\times Salary}{80} \\frac{Service \\times Salary}{80} and \\frac{Service \\times (Salary - LEL)}{60} \\frac{Service \\times (Salary - LEL)}{60} . Two salaries have been defined in the Salary Tab i.e. Salary1 is Salary with no deduction and Salary2 is Salary with a LEL deduction. The benefits on Tier 1 will be set up to define the 1/80ths benefit. The benefits on Tier 2 will be set up to define the excess of the 1/60th benefit over the 1/80th benefit where this is greater than 0. Specify the 1/60th benefit on Tier 2 then check the box to deduct Tier 1. Also ensure that the Minimum Pension specified is zero. (This will ensure the excess is only valued where greater than zero.) The total benefit valued by the Tiers will be: 1/80ths + Max (1/60ths \u2013 1/80ths, 0) multiplied by the respective salaries and service.

Guarantee Period (years) Enter the period for which the member\u2019s pension is guaranteed to be paid irrespective of whether the member survives this period. For a 5 years post retirement guarantee enter 5 . If no guarantee is payable enter 0 . For Pensioners the remaining years guarantee period will be calculated using the member\u2019s standard data item DPC - Date Pension Commenced . Overlap on Death in Guarantee Period If the member\u2019s pension is guaranteed, then the option to select how the guarantee is paid becomes available. Check this box if, on the member\u2019s death during the guarantee period, all outstanding payments in the guarantee period are paid as a lump sum at death and any spouse\u2019s reversion becomes payable immediately. When valuing Actives or Deferreds or using the annuity calculators, the option to select whether this benefit is discounted or undiscounted becomes available. For Pensioners, the lump sum is calculated as the sum of the undiscounted payments at the point of death when this option is selected. Leave this box unchecked if, on the member\u2019s death during the guarantee period, payments continue until the end of the guarantee period and any spouse\u2019s reversion becomes payable thereafter. Payments are always discounted in this scenario. Discounted LS on Death in Guarantee Period The field is used to specify whether the Lump Sum paid as a result of a guarantee after death is discounted or undiscounted for Actives, Deferreds and the Annuity Calculator. Check this box to discount, with interest, the lump sum payable. Leave this box unchecked if the lump sum payable is undiscounted. Deferment Age Specify the Deferment Age (if any) in years (expressed in terms of the age of the primary annuitant). This will be after the start age for the annuitant. Ceasing Age The age at which annuity payments will cease in years (expressed in terms of the age of the primary annuitant). The maximum allowable age of 120 will include payments for the life of the primary annuitant (and reversionary payments, if any, for the life of the reversionary annuitant). Payment Frequency Select from the drop-down list the frequency of the pension payments. The options are: Annual Semi-Annual Quarterly Monthly Lunar-Monthly Fortnightly Weekly Continuous Payment Mode Select from the drop-down list the timing of pension payments. The options are: In Arrears In Advance Proportions Married Table Double click to select the table containing the proportion married for members at each age. In ongoing runs, these fields are used to determine the proportion of the member\u2019s benefit paid to a spouse or partner on death in service (actives only), death in deferment or death after retirement. The field Spouse\u2019s Definition enables you to select how the proportion married is applied. In PPF runs the fields in the Scheme PPF parameters can be used to enter the proportion married separately for male and female spouses and male and female partners. If 90% of members are assumed to be married at all ages then enter a table containing 0.9 . More information is available in the Infocus Document called Proportion Married. Related Selecting rate tables Decr Help Rate tables can be selected by any of the following methods: Right-click on the field for a list of appropriate Rate Tables. For a field that will accept more than one type of Rate Table (e.g. Miscellaneous Tables), the list will be restricted to the current Table Type specified in the field \u2013 if you wish to see all allowable Rate Tables, delete the Table Type from the field before clicking; or Double Clicking on the field will produce the Rate Tables form where Rate Tables can be viewed (numerically and graphically) and Rate Tables can be added or edited. A Rate Table can be selected by pressing the Select button or double clicking on the Rate Table description in the tree; or the list of allowable Rate Tables can be scrolled through by pressing the < or > keys. The description of the Rate Table to the right of the field will change as each new Table is selected. Age Rating Any Rate Table can be rated up or down by a number of years as required to make the rate at every age lighter or heavier than in the original table. A value of +10 will result, for example, in the value selected for a 30 year old actually being the rate for a 40 year old and for a value of -5 would mean that the value at age 25 is selected. If an age rating of a fraction of a year is required, a new table will have to be created through the Edit rate table option on the Rate Table form. % Rating A percentage adjustment can be made to either a Rate Table or a Salary. The Rate Tables can be adjusted by a percentage loading to make the decrement rate lighter or heavier than the original table. The salary for new entrants can be loaded to reflect changes in the salary profile. Enter the number as percentage above 100% i.e. if a loading of 110% is required then enter 10 or if a loading of 90% then enter -10 . If no adjustment is required then leave blank. Proportion Married Users can express the proportion married as a single percentage across all ages. Spouse's Age Difference (x-y) This field is used to set an age difference between a member and their spouse that is identical for all members. It is used when valuing death benefits prior to retirement and contingent annuities on death after retirement. For pensioners death benefits prior to retirement may occur when the Benefit Commencing Age is after the member\u2019s current age. Enter the relevant value containing Member\u2019s Age minus Spouse\u2019s Age ie if Members are 3 years older than their spouse enter 3 . If you wish to use an Age Rating that varies with the member\u2019s age then leave this field blank and the Age Difference Table will become available. (This functionality is not available for PPF runs or for the annuity calculators.) The Age Difference Table field is only available to some users. Spouse's Reversion Enter the reversion payable to the spouse (if any) expressed as a percentage of the member\u2019s annuity. Reversion payable to Spouse on Death in Deferment If there is a deferment period, check the box to include in the calculation a reversionary annuity payable to the spouse on the death of the member during that deferment period. Value Spouse's Reversion only Check this if the annuity for only the Spouse\u2019s Reversion is required. Interest Rate (% p.a.) This is the annual rate at which benefits will be discounted. Select from the drop-down list the Global Financial Parameter that contains the rate applicable. Once selected the current value of the Global Financial Parameter is shown to the right of this field. When using the annuity calculators, a fixed value may also be entered i.e. 9 for 9.00%. To add a new Global Financial Parameter use the Edit Scheme Financials button at the bottom of this Tab. Specify a Different Rate of Return on Reinvestment while in Deferment Reinvestment Rate in Deferment (% p.a.) Check this box to allow for a different rate of return on the reinvestment of investment earnings during the period of deferment. You will then be required to enter a Reinvestment Rate in Deferment. This will be used to determine a modified discount rate for this period. Select from the drop-down list the Global Financial Parameter that contains the rate applicable. Once selected the current value of the Global Financial Parameter is shown to the right of this field. To add a new Global Financial Parameter use the Edit Scheme Financials button at the bottom of this Tab. Revaluation in Deferment (% p.a.) This is the annual rate of increase in the benefit during the deferment period. Select from the drop-down list the Global Financial Parameter that contains the rate applicable. Once selected the current value of the Global Financial Parameter is shown to the right of this field. To add a new Global Financial Parameter use the Edit Scheme Financials button at the bottom of this Tab. Pension Increases in Payment (% p.a.) This is the annual rate of increase in the pension once in payment. Select from the drop-down list the Global Financial Parameter that contains the rate applicable. Once selected the current value of the Global Financial Parameter is shown to the right of this field. To add a new Global Financial Parameter use the Edit Scheme Financials button at the bottom of this Tab.

Consolidation This folder is where the results database will be written (SVResultsDB) Mortality Improvement Contain mortality improvement tables; default is library folder The above folders contain all the files used for a particular Scheme Valuation. Note that it is not necessary to specify these as different folder paths. Input, Yield Curve, Output and Consolidation can all be the same folder path if preferred. If Mortality Improvement is at the system level though, it must be on the same drive as the library folder.

This should be reflected in the Commutation Factors entered into the table ie for ages prior to NRA the factor in the table should be the factor that would apply at the point of exit. For example, a factor of 9 at age 65 means that for every pound surrendered in pension at age 65 the member would receive \u00a39 in cash.

A different description for each of the types of decrement will enable identification when browsing the output and displaying the results. Modes of Exit to be Analysed Select one or more Modes of Exit to be investigated from the list. Any number of modes of exit can be specified to be investigated in combination to represent one cause of exit (for example when you are investigating all forms of age retirement \u2013 normal, early and late). Start Age The Start Age is the minimum age at which investigation results will be output to the file (or in the review of the investigation, the graphical display). Note that the results for all ages are calculated (and saved). The Start Age can be adjusted when reviewing the investigation results. End Age The End Age is the maximum age at which investigation results will be output to the file (or in the review of the investigation, the graphical display). It is rounded to the next highest multiple of the Grouping of Data factor from the Start Age. Note that the results for all ages are calculated (and saved). The End Age can be adjusted when reviewing the investigation results. Grouping of Results - Every The Grouping of Data factor determines the size of the age sub-divisions used to summarise investigation results output to the file (or in the review of the investigation, the graphical display). Note that the results for all ages are calculated (and saved). The Grouping of Data factor can be adjusted when reviewing the investigation results. Upper Limit of Durations Analysed Specify the Upper Limits of the Durations to be investigated (subject to the limit that only 20 years of durational experience is stored). To enable you to build durational specific rates of withdrawal, the exposure and actual exits for all decrement investigation runs are calculated by both age and duration (up to 20 years, beyond that is grouped into an \u201cultimate\u201d group). You can specify a series of upper limits of Durations to be Analysed in which decrements will be investigated. The lower limit will be one greater than the previous upper limit specified. If, say, the first upper limit specified is 5 , rates will be calculated in respect of exits and exposure contributed in the first five years of Scheme membership. If ultimate rates only are required, specify an upper limit greater than 20, eg the default of 99 suggested. A separate page of output will be produced for the durations between each pair of durations specified. Note that the exposure and number of exits is saved for all durations up to 20 years so the upper limits on the Durational Ranges can be subsequently changed when producing the graphical displays. Save the Results for Sub Groups The results (for all files or sub-groups combined) of every investigation are always saved (to a saved results file). These results are stored using the description applied to the parameter set when saved. This option allows you to also save the results for each of the files or sub-groups specified as well. These results are stored using the description of the saved parameter set with a suffix of the sub-group data filename. Stored results for each of the sub-groups means that: males and females can be investigated simultaneously but separate results can be reviewed; and/or the appropriateness of the Rate Table found to be the best fit for the whole group can be checked against each of the sub-groups. It is possible to delete stored investigation results when reviewing the investigation. It is recommended that any results for inappropriate groupings such as heterogeneous groups (eg males and females combined when the decrement should clearly be different) or any small groups (for which comparisons are not reliable) or for any runs containing erroneous data should be deleted to avoid possible error.

A different description for each of the types of decrement will enable identification when browsing the output and displaying the results. Modes of Exit to be Analysed Select one or more Modes of Exit to be investigated from the list. Any number of modes of exit can be specified to be investigated in combination to represent one cause of exit (for example when you are investigating all forms of age retirement \u2013 normal, early and late). Start Age The Start Age is the minimum age at which investigation results will be output to the file (or in the review of the investigation, the graphical display). Note that the results for all ages are calculated (and saved). The Start Age can be adjusted when reviewing the investigation results. End Age The End Age is the maximum age at which investigation results will be output to the file (or in the review of the investigation, the graphical display). It is rounded to the next highest multiple of the Grouping of Data factor from the Start Age. Note that the results for all ages are calculated (and saved). The End Age can be adjusted when reviewing the investigation results. Grouping of Results - Every The Grouping of Data factor determines the size of the age sub-divisions used to summarise investigation results output to the file (or in the review of the investigation, the graphical display). Note that the results for all ages are calculated (and saved). The Grouping of Data factor can be adjusted when reviewing the investigation results. Upper Limit of Durations Analysed Specify the Upper Limits of the Durations to be investigated (subject to the limit that only 20 years of durational experience is stored). To enable you to build durational specific rates of withdrawal, the exposure and actual exits for all decrement investigation runs are calculated by both age and duration (up to 20 years, beyond that is grouped into an \u201cultimate\u201d group). You can specify a series of upper limits of Durations to be Analysed in which decrements will be investigated. The lower limit will be one greater than the previous upper limit specified. If, say, the first upper limit specified is 5 , rates will be calculated in respect of exits and exposure contributed in the first five years of Scheme membership. If ultimate rates only are required, specify an upper limit greater than 20, eg the default of 99 suggested. A separate page of output will be produced for the durations between each pair of durations specified. Note that the exposure and number of exits is saved for all durations up to 20 years so the upper limits on the Durational Ranges can be subsequently changed when producing the graphical displays. Save the Results for Sub Groups The results (for all files or sub-groups combined) of every investigation are always saved (to a saved results file). These results are stored using the description applied to the parameter set when saved. This option allows you to also save the results for each of the files or sub-groups specified as well. These results are stored using the description of the saved parameter set with a suffix of the sub-group data filename. Stored results for each of the sub-groups means that: males and females can be investigated simultaneously but separate results can be reviewed; and/or the appropriateness of the Rate Table found to be the best fit for the whole group can be checked against each of the sub-groups. It is possible to delete stored investigation results when reviewing the investigation. It is recommended that any results for inappropriate groupings such as heterogeneous groups (eg males and females combined when the decrement should clearly be different) or any small groups (for which comparisons are not reliable) or for any runs containing erroneous data should be deleted to avoid possible error. Expected Table The Rate Table Code of the expected table for comparison with the actual Scheme experience. The starting point for the comparison table is generally the expected table that was assumed at the previous investigation. Related Selecting rate tables Decr Help Rate tables can be selected by any of the following methods: Right-click on the field for a list of appropriate Rate Tables. For a field that will accept more than one type of Rate Table (e.g. Miscellaneous Tables), the list will be restricted to the current Table Type specified in the field \u2013 if you wish to see all allowable Rate Tables, delete the Table Type from the field before clicking; or Double Clicking on the field will produce the Rate Tables form where Rate Tables can be viewed (numerically and graphically) and Rate Tables can be added or edited. A Rate Table can be selected by pressing the Select button or double clicking on the Rate Table description in the tree; or the list of allowable Rate Tables can be scrolled through by pressing the < or > keys. The description of the Rate Table to the right of the field will change as each new Table is selected. Age Rating Any Rate Table can be rated up or down by a number of years as required to make the rate at every age lighter or heavier than in the original table. A value of +10 will result, for example, in the value selected for a 30 year old actually being the rate for a 40 year old and for a value of -5 would mean that the value at age 25 is selected. If an age rating of a fraction of a year is required, a new table will have to be created through the Edit rate table option on the Rate Table form. Percentage Rating A percentage adjustment can be made to either a Rate Table or a Salary. The Rate Tables can be adjusted by a percentage loading to make the decrement rate lighter or heavier than the original table. The salary for new entrants can be loaded to reflect changes in the salary profile. Enter the number as percentage above 100% i.e. if a loading of 110% is required then enter 10 or if a loading of 90% then enter -10 . If no adjustment is required then leave blank.

A Rate Table can be selected by pressing the Select button or double clicking on the Rate Table description in the tree; or the list of allowable Rate Tables can be scrolled through by pressing the < or > keys. The description of the Rate Table to the right of the field will change as each new Table is selected. Age Rating Any Rate Table can be rated up or down by a number of years as required to make the rate at every age lighter or heavier than in the original table. A value of +10 will result, for example, in the value selected for a 30 year old actually being the rate for a 40 year old and for a value of -5 would mean that the value at age 25 is selected. If an age rating of a fraction of a year is required, a new table will have to be created through the Edit rate table option on the Rate Table form. Percentage Rating A percentage adjustment can be made to either a Rate Table or a Salary. The Rate Tables can be adjusted by a percentage loading to make the decrement rate lighter or heavier than the original table. The salary for new entrants can be loaded to reflect changes in the salary profile. Enter the number as percentage above 100% i.e. if a loading of 110% is required then enter 10 or if a loading of 90% then enter -10 . If no adjustment is required then leave blank.

If an age rating of a fraction of a year is required, a new table will have to be created through the Edit rate table option on the Rate Table form. % Rating A percentage adjustment can be made to either a Rate Table or a Salary. The Rate Tables can be adjusted by a percentage loading to make the decrement rate lighter or heavier than the original table. The salary for new entrants can be loaded to reflect changes in the salary profile. Enter the number as percentage above 100% i.e. if a loading of 110% is required then enter 10 or if a loading of 90% then enter -10 . If no adjustment is required then leave blank.

Select from the drop-down list which of these to apply. The options are: None Partial Franking Full Franking Maximum Franking No Anti Franking Guarantee An example to illustrate how these different options work is set out below: Suppose you have a male member retiring at 60 with a pension as follows: Pension = \u00a32,000 GMP at 60 = \u00a31,000 (included in above figure) GMP at 65 = \u00a31,500 GMP revaluations between 60 and 65 are therefore \u00a3500 (\u00a31,500 less \u00a31,000). Once in payment, the pension will increase at 5% per annum. The additional pension at SPA for the GMP revaluations between 60 and 65 under each of the options are as follows: None All of the revaluations on the GMP are added to the pension at SPA. So, the pension at 65 is calculated as \u00a32,000 \\times 1.05^5 + \u00a3500 = \u00a33,053 \u00a32,000 \\times 1.05^5 + \u00a3500 = \u00a33,053 Partial Franking Revaluations on the GMP between retirement and SPA, less scheme increases granted on the GMP, are added to the pension at SPA. So, the pension at 65 is calculated as \u00a32,000 \\times 1.05^5 + \\left[ 500 \u2013 1,000 \\times \\left( 1.05^5 \u2013 1 \\right) \\right] = \u00a32,776 \u00a32,000 \\times 1.05^5 + \\left[ 500 \u2013 1,000 \\times \\left( 1.05^5 \u2013 1 \\right) \\right] = \u00a32,776 Note that the difference between the GMP revaluations and scheme increases on the GMP can not be used to reduce the pension payable ie the item in square brackets cannot be negative. Full Franking All of the increases on the pension between retirement and SPA are franked against revaluation on the GMP. So, the pension at 65 is calculated as \u00a32,000 \\times 1.05^5 + \\left[ 500 - 2,000 \\times \\left( 1.05^5 \u2013 1 \\right) \\right] = \u00a32,553 \u00a32,000 \\times 1.05^5 + \\left[ 500 - 2,000 \\times \\left( 1.05^5 \u2013 1 \\right) \\right] = \u00a32,553 Note that the difference between the GMP revaluations and scheme increases on the whole pension can not be used to reduce the pension payable i.e. the item in square brackets cannot be negative. Maximum This option differs from Full Franking only if you have an early retirement decrement in your basis. For the early retirements the calculation assumes there is No Anti-Franking guarantee. So the pension at 65 is calculated as \u00a32,000 \\times 1.05^5 = \u00a32,553 \u00a32,000 \\times 1.05^5 = \u00a32,553 For the normal retirement the calculation assumes Full Franking.

No Anti Franking Guarantee No antifranking guarantee is made at SPA. So, the pension at 65 is calculated as \u00a32,000 \\times 1.05^5 = \u00a32,553 \u00a32,000 \\times 1.05^5 = \u00a32,553 Franking In Deferment Check this box if you want to allow for franking in deferment. The GMP benefits will not be added to the other PUPs but will be compared with the total Excess pension at each age and the greater of the two benefits valued. This enable the user to value PUPs that pre-date anti-franking legislation. The calculations will take account of any pre SPA increases, Barber Adjustment and the Underpin before comparing the benefits. The GMP payable on normal or early retirement before SPA may be different from the GMP at SPA increased in line with statutory requirements. Statutory GMP Increases to NRA>SPA This field determines the pension increases that are used to increase the GMP between SPA and NRA for retirements after SPA. Check the box to increase GMPs by 1/7% per week, then by the assumed statutory GMP increases from SPA to NRA. The statutory GMP increases are hard-coded in SuperVal and are assumed to be 0% annually for Pre-1988 GMP and 3% annually for Post-1988 GMP. Leave the box unchecked to increase the GMPs by 1/7% per week, then by the user specified pension escalation in payment from SPA to NRA. The pension increases in payment are those specified for Pre-1988 GMP and Post-1988 GMP respectively on the Financial tab. Public Sector GMPs Check this box to value public sector style treatment of GMPs. Leave this box unchecked to value private sector style treatment of GMPs. This field is only available to some users. Male PPF NRA (Levy Valuations) Female PPF NRA (Levy Valuations) On the Legislation Tab, enter the NRA to be attached to the GMP, which is converted in to excess pension, for PPF valuations. Elsewhere, for Actives and Deferreds, select from the drop-down list which of the previously defined PPF NRAs applies to the pension or benefit slice. The PPF NRAs are specified on the PPF/Cap Tab. For Pensioners enter the normal retirement age to be used as the PPF NRA in the PPF (S179 Levy) Valuation. The PPF NRAs are only used to determine the level of capping required. They do not override the Benefit Commencing Age. To allow for ill health retirements, use a sufficiently low age so that all members exceed this age i.e. 16. To allow for early retirement pensions, use an age such as 50. Treat Pre 1988 GMP As Zero Treat Post 1988 GMP As Zero Check these boxes if you want to ignore either the Pre-1988 GMP or the Post-1988 GMP. (Check both boxes to ignore both.)

Check these boxes if you wish the Multiple or the Percentage to be based on the PUPs excluding either the Pre-1988 GMP or the Post-1988 GMP amount. (Check both boxes to exclude both.) Leave these boxes unchecked to include either the Pre-1988 GMP or the Post-1988 GMP amount. Please note that where either the Pre-1988 GMP or the Post-1988 GMP is included, SuperVal will restrict any pension commuted to ensure that no GMP is exchanged for cash. Ignore Pre 1988 GMP For Death Benefit Ignore Post 1988 GMP For Death Benefit Select how to value both the Pre-1988 GMP and the Post-1988 GMP for Death Benefits. The options are: Yes No Legislation. The options are available for the Pre-1988 GMP and Post-1988 GMP separately. If Yes is selected then no death before retirement benefits will be payable in respect of either the Pre-1988 GMP or the Post-1988 GMP. If No is selected then SuperVal will value the Pre-1988 GMP or the Post-1988 GMP multiplied by the Spouse\u2019s Reversion Death before Retirement on death before retirement. If Legislation is selected then the benefits payable on death before retirement will follow legislation i.e. a 50% spouse\u2019s pension on death before retirement will be payable in respect of the Pre-1988 GMP for male members only and a 50% spouse\u2019s pension for all members in respect of the Post-1988 GMP. Pre 1988 Start Date Post 1988 Start Date If you have selected to Use Barber Start and End Dates in either the Pre-1988 GMP ERF Indicator or the Post-1988 GMP ERF Indicator or Split According to Service in the Pre/Post-1988 GMP Underpin Indicator then SuperVal requires a Start Date and a Finish Date for the Pre-1988 GMP or the Post-1988 GMP. The Start Date can either be a fixed date or a data item. To use a fixed date enter the date here. The date should be in the DD/MM/CCYY format.

The options are: Commutation On top None Note: This field is only available to some users. Cash Multiple Cash Percentage The commuted cash can be calculated either as a Multiple or a Percentage of the PUP. If an entry is made in the Multiple field, the commuted cash will be calculated as: Multiple \u00d7 PUP revalued to retirement \u00d7 Early Retirement Reduction Factor (if applicable). The Multiple can either be a fixed Multiple for all members or a Member Specific Multiple. To use a fixed Multiple enter the value i.e. for 4 times the PUP enter 4 . To use a Member Specific Multiple, select from the drop-down list the data item containing the appropriate value. To value commutation of 4 times the PUP ensure the data item contains the value 4. To value a Percentage, ensure the entry in the Multiple field is blank. The commuted cash can be calculated as: Percentage \u00d7 PUP revalued to retirement \u00d7 Commutation Factor \u00d7 Early Retirement Reduction Factor (if applicable). The Percentage can either be a fixed Percentage for all members or a Member Specific Percentage. To use a fixed Percentage enter the value ie for 25% enter 25 . To use a Member Specific Percentage, select from the drop-down list the data item containing the appropriate value. To value commutation of 25% of the PUP ensure the data item contains the value 25. General Commutation is restricted to avoid commuting the GMP. There is no allowance for post-retirement increases in calculating this restriction. Cash Data Item SuperVal does not have the functionality to value an explicit Cash Commuted Data item. However, as a work around users can enter the Member Specific Commuted Cash as a data item in the Cap Cash Amount below. They should then enter either a Percentage or a Multiple here. The Percentage or the Multiple entered should be sufficiently large so that the data item entered in the Cap Cash Amount will bite for all members. Separate A-Day Cash Factors for each Pension Increase This field indicates if separate A Day cash factors are to be calculated for each pension increase or whether a single factor applies to the entire pension. If a User opts for the average factor approach which means the field is left unchecked, then the User needs to select whether the average factor will be applied Pro Rata or Priority. Treat Independent PUP Cash as Cash on Top Users sometimes value Cash on Top in the Ind Slices and Ind PUPs giving data items the same payment start and end age. If the intention is to include this Cash on Top amount in the A Day max calculation, then this box should be checked. If this box is unchecked the system will still value cash amounts in the Ind Slices and Ind PUPs but the A Day maximum will not be reduced to allow for this Cash on Top (if the basis has Percentage of A Day Cash commutation specified). Commutation Priority This field is used to determine the order in which pension will be commuted for cash. Select from the drop-down list which of the options to use. The options are: After Split (actives only) Before Split (actives only) Priority Pro Rata If After Split or Before Split is used then the pension is commuted by reference to the Latest Finish Date specified on the Offset Slice . Typically an active member will have a service timeline as shown in the following diagram: If After Split is selected then the pension accrued after the End of the Offset Slice would be commuted first. Within each period pension may increase at different rates and are commuted in the following order: Special Main Pension Increase 3 Pension Increase 4 If Before Split is selected then the pension accrued before End of the Offset Slice would be commuted first. Within each period pension may increase at different rates and are commuted in the following order: Special Main Pension Increase 3 Pension Increase 4 If Priority is selected then the cash is commuted according to the pension increase rate applied on the Slices or PUP Tab. Pensions are commuted in the following order: Special Main Pension Increase 3 Pension Increase 4 If Pro Rata is selected, then pension is commuted in proportion to the pension amounts, irrespective of the pension increase rate. Male Commutation Tables Parameter Set Female Commutation Tables Parameter Set Commutation Tables Parameter Set is a Scheme Global parameter which groups the Male or Female Commutation table variables. This can be created by using either the Create Globals function or using the Add/Edit Commutation Table button. Once created, these parameters can be edited without going back into the Basis similar to other global parameter sets. Calculate Male Commutation Factors based on Valuation Basis Calculate Female Commutation Factors based on Valuation Basis SuperVal will calculate commutation factors applicable to each individual member using the valuation basis and the all relevant Basis Parameters (Guarantee Period, Post Retirement Mortality, Post Retirement Interest rate and Pension Increases). Male % of Valuation Basis Factor Female % of Valuation Basis Factor Users can define the % of Valuation Basis Factor they want to apply to the Scheme. To have this field visible the above field Calculate Male/Female Commutation Factors based on Valuation Basis needs to be ticked. The Valuation Factors produced by SuperVal can be seen in individual VARPRINTs. Male Main Male Special Male PenInc3 Male PenInc4 Female Main Female Special Female PenInc3 Female PenInc4 Double click to select the rate table containing the Commutation Factors ie the amount of cash received for each pound per annum of pension commuted. Please note that SuperVal assumes exits prior to NRA occur half-way through the year i.e. 0.5 years, 1.5 years etc after the valuation date. Exits at NRA occur at the beginning of the year. This should be reflected in the Commutation Factors entered into the table ie for ages prior to NRA the factor in the table should be the factor that would apply at the point of exit. For example, a factor of 9 at age 65 means that for every pound surrendered in pension at age 65 the member would receive \u00a39 in cash. Separate tables can be specified for males and females and for each of the different pension increase rates (Main, Special, Pension Increase 3 and Pension Increase 4) being used. Even if cash is payable on top of pension benefits, cash commutation factors are still required for application of IR Maximum rules. Related Selecting rate tables Decr Help Rate tables can be selected by any of the following methods: Right-click on the field for a list of appropriate Rate Tables. For a field that will accept more than one type of Rate Table (e.g. Miscellaneous Tables), the list will be restricted to the current Table Type specified in the field \u2013 if you wish to see all allowable Rate Tables, delete the Table Type from the field before clicking; or Double Clicking on the field will produce the Rate Tables form where Rate Tables can be viewed (numerically and graphically) and Rate Tables can be added or edited. A Rate Table can be selected by pressing the Select button or double clicking on the Rate Table description in the tree; or the list of allowable Rate Tables can be scrolled through by pressing the < or > keys. The description of the Rate Table to the right of the field will change as each new Table is selected. Linearly Interpolate Male Commutation Tables for mid-point Exit values Linearly Interpolate Female Commutation Tables for mid-point Exit values When checked, the system will linearly interpolate factors for mid year exits such as early retirements and deaths. For Normal Retirements, the system will apply no interpolation. If unchecked, the system will use the factor specified at the age nearest rounded down for mid year exits as previous versions have done. Adjust Male Commutation Tables by the change in member's expectation of life Adjust Female Commutation Tables by the change in member's expectation of life Future mortality-improvement assumptions underlying the Technical Provisions can be applied to the tabulated commutation factors in force at the valuation date, to calculate revised commutation factors at the date of exit. Cash Cap Amount SuperVal allows the user to enter a Cap on the cash benefit payable. Select from the drop-down list the appropriate data item. If the cash benefit is not restricted leave blank. SuperVal will value the lower of the Cash Cap Amount and the cash benefits specified on the Ret Cash Tab. To value the Cash Cap Amount as the cash benefit ensure the cash benefits described on the Ret Cash Tab exceed the data item for all members. % of Cash Cap Amount The Cash Cap Amount data item can be reduced or increased by entering a percentage of the data item to value. Enter 100 to value 100% of the data item as the Cash Cap Amount. Revaluation Rate Override The user has the option to enter an override for the rate at which the Cash Cap Amount will increase in deferment. Select from the drop-down list the Global Financial Parameter that contains the rate applicable. Once selected, the current value is shown to the right of this field. To add a new Global Financial Parameter use the Edit Scheme Financials button at the bottom of this Tab. If you do not wish to use this option then leave blank. Complete Years Only Override The user has the option to enter an override for the Count Complete Years entered on the Financial Tab. Exits before NRA such as early retirement and death in deferment are assumed to occur half way through the year i.e. 0.5, 1.5, 2.5 years after the valuation date. By selecting Yes these benefits will receive revaluations for the number of complete years only i.e. 0, 1, 2. By selecting No these benefits will receive an additional half-year of revaluations i.e. 0.5, 1.5, 2.5. If you do not wish to use this option then leave blank.

Accrual Rate Accrual Rate Data Item Enter both the numerator and the denominator for the rate of accrual where this is the same for all members for this Benefit Slice i.e. for 1/60th accrual enter 1 in the numerator and 60 in the denominator. If the accrual rate varies by member, then leave these two fields blank and this will enable you to enter an Accrual Rate Data Item instead. Select from the drop-down list the data item containing the Member Specific Accrual Rate. The data item should contain the Accrual Rate as a percentage i.e. for 1/60th use 0.01667 . (This might be used when each member has a targeted benefit of 2/3rds over their career but receive a pro-rata amount on earlier exit. The Member Specific Accrual Rate Calculator can be used to calculate such a data item.) The benefit from the Tier will be calculated as the accrual rate (numerator/denominator) times Salary times service. The service would be the period specified on the Benefit Slice, or Accelerated Service Table , or Added Years . When using Accelerated Service Tables or Service Related Accrual Tables , enter the underlying Accrual Rate that applies to all service here. Either the Accelerated Service Table or the Service Related Accrual Table will contain the number of years of the underlying Accrual Rate at each duration.

Accrual Rate Table If the accrual rate varies by age or service then this field can be used instead of Accrual Rate or the Accrual Rate Data Item . Accrual varies by duration of service If the accrual rate varies by service, then the table entered is indexed by the service period defined on the Benefit Slice. Double click to select an HT type table that contains the cumulative Accrual Rate Table. (Note the service defined on the slice is only used to reference the table and not in the Benefit Calculations.) For example, if the accrual rate was 80ths for the first 10 years service and then 60ths thereafter, the table would have 0.1250 at duration 10 (10 \u00d7 1/80) and 0.1417 at duration 11 (10/80 + 1/60). Accrual Varies by age If the accrual rate varies by age, then the table entered is indexed by the member\u2019s age. Double click to select an HX type table that contains the Accrual Rate for each age. The rate at the members age will then be multiplied by the service period defined for the Benefit Slice. For example, if the accrual rate was 80ths before age 40 and 60ths thereafter, the table would hold the value 0.0125 at each age below 40 and 0.0167 at each age above 40. Please note that the Accrual Rate Table can only be applied to service in a single Slice and cannot be applied across Benefit Slices (or Tiers). To value different Accrual Rates across different Slices then consider using the Service Related Accrual Table . Some functionality only available to some users. Related Selecting rate tables Decr Help Rate tables can be selected by any of the following methods: Right-click on the field for a list of appropriate Rate Tables. For a field that will accept more than one type of Rate Table (e.g. Miscellaneous Tables), the list will be restricted to the current Table Type specified in the field \u2013 if you wish to see all allowable Rate Tables, delete the Table Type from the field before clicking; or Double Clicking on the field will produce the Rate Tables form where Rate Tables can be viewed (numerically and graphically) and Rate Tables can be added or edited. A Rate Table can be selected by pressing the Select button or double clicking on the Rate Table description in the tree; or the list of allowable Rate Tables can be scrolled through by pressing the < or > keys. The description of the Rate Table to the right of the field will change as each new Table is selected. Accelerated Service Table If the service granted for each year of accrual is greater than actual service then this field can be used to determine the service credit. Double click to select an ET type table containing the cumulative service credit that will be indexed by the period of service defined on the Benefit Slice. The corresponding value in the ET table will be used in the Benefit Calculations. (Part years will be linearly interpolated.) For example, a member receives an additional 5 years pensionable service on completion of 10 years. The ET table would have an entry of 9 at duration 9 and 15 at duration 10, 16 at 11 etc. The Accelerated Service Table should not be used with a maximum service restriction but instead the maximum service should be contained within the Table used. Please note that the Accelerated Service Table can only be applied to service in a single Slice and cannot be applied across Benefit Slices (or Tiers). To value different Accrual Rates across different Slices then consider using the Service Related Accrual Table . Some functionality is only available to some users. Related Selecting rate tables Fixed Pension Select from the drop-down list the data item containing the Fixed Pension Amount. This might have arisen from either a transfer-in or a past service CARE benefit. Increase in Service If the Benefit Basis is CARE, then this pension amount will be increased in service at the CARE Revaluation Rate . If the Benefit Basis is Final Salary, then this pension amount will not be increased in service. (To value a fixed pension that increases in line with salaries, instead consider defining a salary equal to the pension amount and setting up a Slice with an accrual rate of 1/1 multiplied one year of service. Increase in Deferment This pension amount will be increased in deferment at the Revaluation in Deferment Rate specified on the Slices Tab. (The rate chosen will impact on the Early-Retirement Factors that are used.) Note: A Pension Data Item and benefit accrual can be specified in the same Slice as long as they are on different Tiers. Alternatively they can be specified on different Slices. Minimum Pension This field can be used to define a minimum amount of pension that will be provided from this Tier of the particular Slice. This can either be fixed for all members of be member specific. Either enter the amount of the minimum pension or select from the drop-down list the data item containing the member specific data. The amount entered will not be increased by SuperVal between the valuation date and the point of exit ie retirement, withdrawal, death. If no minimum applies then leave this field blank. Maximum Pension This field can be used to define a maximum amount of pension that that will be provided from this Tier of the particular Slice. This can either be fixed for all members of be member specific. Either enter the amount of the maximum pension or select from the drop-down list the data item containing the member specific data. The amount entered will not be increased by SuperVal between the valuation date and the point of exit ie retirement, withdrawal or death. If no maximum applies then leave this field blank. Pension Adjustment Factor A negative or positive loading can be applied to the pension calculated from this Tier of benefits. This loading can either be fixed for all members or be a member specific amount. For a fixed adjustment, enter the number as a multiplier i.e. 1.1 for a 10% increase or 0.9 for a 10% decrease. If no adjustment is required enter 1 . If 0 is entered the liability for this Tier will be zero. To value a negative pension based on the parameters on the Tier, enter -1 . For a member specific adjustment, select from the drop-down list the data item containing the member specific adjustment factor. The pension calculated in this Tier will be multiplied by the data item entered in this field. Deduct Tier 1 Deduct Tier 2 You can deduct the benefits calculated on Tier 1 from either of the benefit calculated on Tier 2 or Tier 3. In Tier 3 you can also deduct the sum of benefits calculated in Tiers 1 and 2. Check these boxes to determine which of the Tiers are deducted. Typical use of this field is for a greater-of benefit comparison. For example, suppose a scheme provides a benefit which is the greater of \\frac{Service \\times Salary}{80} \\frac{Service \\times Salary}{80} and \\frac{Service \\times (Salary - LEL)}{60} \\frac{Service \\times (Salary - LEL)}{60} . Two salaries have been defined in the Salary Tab i.e. Salary1 is Salary with no deduction and Salary2 is Salary with a LEL deduction. The benefits on Tier 1 will be set up to define the 1/80ths benefit. The benefits on Tier 2 will be set up to define the excess of the 1/60th benefit over the 1/80th benefit where this is greater than 0. Specify the 1/60th benefit on Tier 2 then check the box to deduct Tier 1. Also ensure that the Minimum Pension specified is zero. (This will ensure the excess is only valued where greater than zero.) The total benefit valued by the Tiers will be: 1/80ths + Max (1/60ths \u2013 1/80ths, 0) multiplied by the respective salaries and service. Male PPF Adjustment Factor Female PPF Adjustment Factor A negative or positive loading can be applied to the pension calculated from this Tier of benefits on a PPF valuation. This loading can either be fixed for all members or be a member specific amount. For a fixed adjustment, enter the number as a multiplier i.e. 1.1 for a 10% increase or 0.9 for a 10% decrease. If no adjustment is required enter 1 . If 0 is entered the liability for this Tier will be zero. To value a negative pension based on the parameters on the Tier, enter -1 . For a member specific adjustment, select from the drop-down list the data item containing the member specific adjustment factor.

The Member Specific Accrual Rate Calculator can be used to calculate such a data item.) The benefit from the Tier will be calculated as the accrual rate (numerator/denominator) times Salary times service. The service would be the period specified on the Benefit Slice, or Accelerated Service Table , or Added Years .

Double click to select an HT type table that contains the cumulative Accrual Rate Table. (Note the service defined on the slice is only used to reference the table and not in the Benefit Calculations.) For example, if the accrual rate was 80ths for the first 10 years service and then 60ths thereafter, the table would have 0.1250 at duration 10 (10 \u00d7 1/80) and 0.1417 at duration 11 (10/80 + 1/60). Accrual Varies by age If the accrual rate varies by age, then the table entered is indexed by the member\u2019s age. Double click to select an HX type table that contains the Accrual Rate for each age. The rate at the members age will then be multiplied by the service period defined for the Benefit Slice. For example, if the accrual rate was 80ths before age 40 and 60ths thereafter, the table would hold the value 0.0125 at each age below 40 and 0.0167 at each age above 40. Please note that the Accrual Rate Table can only be applied to service in a single Slice and cannot be applied across Benefit Slices (or Tiers).

Double click to select an ET type table containing the cumulative service credit that will be indexed by the period of service defined on the Benefit Slice. The corresponding value in the ET table will be used in the Benefit Calculations. (Part years will be linearly interpolated.) For example, a member receives an additional 5 years pensionable service on completion of 10 years. The ET table would have an entry of 9 at duration 9 and 15 at duration 10, 16 at 11 etc. The Accelerated Service Table should not be used with a maximum service restriction but instead the maximum service should be contained within the Table used.

When using a service related promotional scale the user will be required to input the date from which service will be calculated in the Date for Durational Decrements field on the Demographic Tab. General salary increases are normally specified in the Salary Increase field on the Financial Tab. Alternatively, for a particular salary definition this can be overridden by the Salary Increase Override on the Salaries Tab. Some options are only available to some users. Related Selecting rate tables Decr Help Rate tables can be selected by any of the following methods: Right-click on the field for a list of appropriate Rate Tables. For a field that will accept more than one type of Rate Table (e.g. Miscellaneous Tables), the list will be restricted to the current Table Type specified in the field \u2013 if you wish to see all allowable Rate Tables, delete the Table Type from the field before clicking; or Double Clicking on the field will produce the Rate Tables form where Rate Tables can be viewed (numerically and graphically) and Rate Tables can be added or edited. A Rate Table can be selected by pressing the Select button or double clicking on the Rate Table description in the tree; or the list of allowable Rate Tables can be scrolled through by pressing the < or > keys. The description of the Rate Table to the right of the field will change as each new Table is selected. Review Date If Salary Increase Timing was either Review Date or Weighted then enter the date salaries increase in the form DD/MM. Timing of Salary Increases Select from the drop-down list the timing of salary increases. The options are: Review Date Continuous Weighted If Review Date is selected, salaries will be updated on the date entered in Review Date. If Continuous is selected, salaries will be increased continuously. If Weighted is selected, salaries will be updated on the date entered in Review Date but weighted when calculating Final Average Salary. The projection of Salary is the same for both Review Date and Weighted. The difference relates to the calculation of Final Average Salary. Under Review Date, Final Average Salary is the average salary as at the last N review dates. Under Weighted, Final Average Salary is the average salary over the last N years. Hence, Review Date can be used to model Final Average Salaries that only increase once a year on the Review Date whereas Weighted is used to model Final Average Salaries that increase continuously during the year. For more information on how these different salaries are calculated please see the Infocus Document relating to Salary Projections in SuperVal. Averaging Period Enter the number of years over which salaries are averaged either on leaving or at retirement. Averaging Ceases Select from the drop-down list when the salary averaging should be applied. The options are: On Leaving Service At NRD Under On Leaving Service the salary averaging will be applied on all decrements. Under At NRD the salary averaging will only be applied on exit at Normal Retirement Date. Initial Final Average Salary Select from the drop-down list the data item containing the initial Final Average Salary. This will be used as Final Average Salary as at the valuation date and blended with projected final average salary calculated using Current Salary and Salary Inflation to produce Final Average Salary during the specified averaging period. If left blank, Final Average Salary as at the valuation date will be calculated using Current Salary deflated using the Salary Inflation rate specified. More information on the application of this field can be found in the Infocus Document relating to Salary Projections. Include Last Salary in Average Check this box if the last salary should be included in the final average salary calculation. Leave unchecked to exclude the last salary in the final average salary calculations. If checked, SuperVal will average the salary over the averaging period specified. If unchecked, SuperVal will add 2 years to the averaging period specified. Deduction Initial Value Enter the amount of salary deduction you wish to apply. This can either be a fixed amount for all members or a member specific amount. To use a fixed value across all members, enter the value here. To use a member specific value, select from the drop-down list the appropriate data item. For example, if the pensionable salary definition is reduced by the Lower Earnings Limit, enter the Lower Earnings Limit as at the valuation date in this field. If both a maximum and a deduction are used, then the maximum is applied before the deduction i.e. entering a maximum of Upper Earnings Limit and deduction of a Lower Earnings Limit would give Band Earnings. Adjustment Factor This field allows the user to adjust the deduction by a fixed factor. It might be used where the data used for the deduction is out of date and needs to be increased to take account of an extra part year of inflation. Enter the number as a multiplier, e.g. 1.1 for a 10% increase or 0.9 for a 10% decrease. For no adjustment enter a value of 1 . This field can also be used to add the deduction amount on to the salary. To do this ensure the value entered is negative i.e. -1 to add the deduction, without adjustment, onto the salary. Increase Rate Override This the rate at which the deduction will be increased. Select from the drop-down list the Global Financial Parameter that contains the rate applicable. Once selected, the current value of the Global Financial Parameter is shown to the right of this field. To add a new Global Financial Parameter use the Edit Scheme Financials button at the bottom of this tab. If the Deduction is non-increasing select a Global Financial Parameter set to 0. If this field is left blank, SuperVal will use the Salary Overall Parameters Increase Rate specified on the Financial tab. Maximum Initial Value Enter the amount of salary maximum you wish to apply. This can either be a fixed amount for all members or a member specific amount. To use a fixed value across all members, enter the value here. To use a member specific value, select from the drop-down list the appropriate data item. For example, if the pensionable salary definition is restricted by the Earnings Cap, then enter the Earnings Cap as at the valuation date in this field. If both a maximum and a deduction are used, then the maximum is applied before the deduction i.e. entering a maximum of Upper Earnings Limit and deduction of a Lower Earnings Limit would give Band Earnings. Adjustment Factor This field allows the user to adjust the maximum by a fixed factor. It might be used where the data used for the maximum is out of date and needs to be increased to take account of an extra part year of inflation. Enter the number as a multiplier, e.g. 1.1 for a 10% increase or 0.9 for a 10% decrease. For no adjustment enter a value of 1 . Increase Rate Override This the rate at which the maximum will be increased. Select from the drop-down list the Global Financial Parameter that contains the rate applicable. Once selected, the current value of the Global Financial Parameter is shown to the right of this field. To add a new Global Financial Parameter use the Edit Scheme Financials button at the bottom of this tab. If the maximum is non-increasing select a Global Financial Parameter set to 0.

The member may have left active service before retiring and not yet reached SPA. Therefore the GMP included in the pension may not yet include any revaluation from date of leaving. Male PPF NRA Female PPF NRA On the Legislation Tab, enter the NRA to be attached to the GMP, which is converted in to excess pension, for PPF valuations. Elsewhere, for Actives and Deferreds, select from the drop-down list which of the previously defined PPF NRAs applies to the pension or benefit slice. The PPF NRAs are specified on the PPF/Cap Tab. For Pensioners enter the normal retirement age to be used as the PPF NRA in the PPF (S179 Levy) Valuation. The PPF NRAs are only used to determine the level of capping required. They do not override the Benefit Commencing Age. To allow for ill health retirements, use a sufficiently low age so that all members exceed this age i.e. 16. To allow for early retirement pensions, use an age such as 50. PPF Service Period PPF guidance, requires the user to show separately the Pre-1997 pension, post 6 April 1997 to 5 April 2009 pension and the Post 6 April 2009 pension. Select from the drop-down list whether the pension is: Pre-97 97 to 09 Post-09 PPF Revaluation in Deferment This field can be used to override the Revaluation in Deferment specified for deferred pensions in a PPF S179 (Levy) valuation.

Select from the drop-down list one of the following options: Exact Days Months Rounded Down Nearer Months Months Rounded Up Years Rounded Down Nearer Years Years Rounded Up Complete Tax Years The entry on the Membership Tab will be used unless an Override is specified on a particular Slice. Note, service is rounded on a Slice by Slice basis and there is no rounding for total service. Added Years This field is used to define the number of Added Years either where these are fixed for all members or a member specific amount. To enable it ensure the Start Date for this slice is blank. Added Years might have arisen from an Augmentation exercise or a Transfer-In to the scheme.

Accelerated Service Table If the service granted for each year of accrual is greater than actual service then this field can be used to determine the service credit. Double click to select an ET type table containing the cumulative service credit that will be indexed by the period of service defined on the Benefit Slice. The corresponding value in the ET table will be used in the Benefit Calculations. (Part years will be linearly interpolated.) For example, a member receives an additional 5 years pensionable service on completion of 10 years. The ET table would have an entry of 9 at duration 9 and 15 at duration 10, 16 at 11 etc. The Accelerated Service Table should not be used with a maximum service restriction but instead the maximum service should be contained within the Table used. Please note that the Accelerated Service Table can only be applied to service in a single Slice and cannot be applied across Benefit Slices (or Tiers). To value different Accrual Rates across different Slices then consider using the Service Related Accrual Table . Some functionality is only available to some users. Related Selecting rate tables Service Related Accrual Table This is ET , FT , GT and HT type rate tables, which is indexed by the period of service specified by the Benefit Slice. It is the corresponding entry on the ET , FT , GT and HT table that is used in the benefit calculation. The service period is calculated from DOE Qualifying Service to the start date/end date on the slice. SuperVal will then linearly interpolate to obtain the value for the member\u2019s exact period of service. Typical uses for this table may be uplifted service or extra years of service granted after a certain period. For example, suppose that members receive a further 5 years pensionable service on completion of 10 years. The Service Related Accrual Table would have an entry of 9 at duration 9 and 15 at duration 10, 16 at 11 etc. i.e. the table is cumulative. Please note that the Service Related Accrual Table will be applied across Benefit Slices (or Tiers). If a ET , FT , GT and HT table is not defined, then the service will be the period between the Start Date (or minimum start date) and Finish Date (or maximum finish date) for the Benefit Slice. Allowance would be made for maximum service. Double click to select from the list of available ET , FT , GT and HT type rate tables. When using this field, you will be required to enter the date from which service starts to accrue in the DOE Qualifying Service on the Membership Tab. Not all functionality is available to all users. Related Selecting rate tables Fixed Pension Select from the drop-down list the data item containing the Fixed Pension Amount. This might have arisen from either a transfer-in or a past service CARE benefit. Increase in Service If the Benefit Basis is CARE, then this pension amount will be increased in service at the CARE Revaluation Rate . If the Benefit Basis is Final Salary, then this pension amount will not be increased in service. (To value a fixed pension that increases in line with salaries, instead consider defining a salary equal to the pension amount and setting up a Slice with an accrual rate of 1/1 multiplied one year of service. Increase in Deferment This pension amount will be increased in deferment at the Revaluation in Deferment Rate specified on the Slices Tab. (The rate chosen will impact on the Early-Retirement Factors that are used.) Note: A Pension Data Item and benefit accrual can be specified in the same Slice as long as they are on different Tiers. Alternatively they can be specified on different Slices. Minimum Pension This field can be used to define a minimum amount of pension that will be provided from this Tier of the particular Slice. This can either be fixed for all members of be member specific. Either enter the amount of the minimum pension or select from the drop-down list the data item containing the member specific data. The amount entered will not be increased by SuperVal between the valuation date and the point of exit ie retirement, withdrawal, death. If no minimum applies then leave this field blank. Maximum Pension This field can be used to define a maximum amount of pension that that will be provided from this Tier of the particular Slice. This can either be fixed for all members of be member specific. Either enter the amount of the maximum pension or select from the drop-down list the data item containing the member specific data. The amount entered will not be increased by SuperVal between the valuation date and the point of exit ie retirement, withdrawal or death. If no maximum applies then leave this field blank. Pension Adjustment Factor A negative or positive loading can be applied to the pension calculated from this Tier of benefits. This loading can either be fixed for all members or be a member specific amount. For a fixed adjustment, enter the number as a multiplier i.e. 1.1 for a 10% increase or 0.9 for a 10% decrease. If no adjustment is required enter 1 . If 0 is entered the liability for this Tier will be zero. To value a negative pension based on the parameters on the Tier, enter -1 . For a member specific adjustment, select from the drop-down list the data item containing the member specific adjustment factor. The pension calculated in this Tier will be multiplied by the data item entered in this field. Deduct Tier 1 Deduct Tier 2 You can deduct the benefits calculated on Tier 1 from either of the benefit calculated on Tier 2 or Tier 3. In Tier 3 you can also deduct the sum of benefits calculated in Tiers 1 and 2. Check these boxes to determine which of the Tiers are deducted. Typical use of this field is for a greater-of benefit comparison. For example, suppose a scheme provides a benefit which is the greater of \\frac{Service \\times Salary}{80} \\frac{Service \\times Salary}{80} and \\frac{Service \\times (Salary - LEL)}{60} \\frac{Service \\times (Salary - LEL)}{60} . Two salaries have been defined in the Salary Tab i.e. Salary1 is Salary with no deduction and Salary2 is Salary with a LEL deduction. The benefits on Tier 1 will be set up to define the 1/80ths benefit. The benefits on Tier 2 will be set up to define the excess of the 1/60th benefit over the 1/80th benefit where this is greater than 0. Specify the 1/60th benefit on Tier 2 then check the box to deduct Tier 1. Also ensure that the Minimum Pension specified is zero. (This will ensure the excess is only valued where greater than zero.) The total benefit valued by the Tiers will be: 1/80ths + Max (1/60ths \u2013 1/80ths, 0) multiplied by the respective salaries and service. Male PPF Adjustment Factor Female PPF Adjustment Factor A negative or positive loading can be applied to the pension calculated from this Tier of benefits on a PPF valuation. This loading can either be fixed for all members or be a member specific amount. For a fixed adjustment, enter the number as a multiplier i.e. 1.1 for a 10% increase or 0.9 for a 10% decrease. If no adjustment is required enter 1 . If 0 is entered the liability for this Tier will be zero. To value a negative pension based on the parameters on the Tier, enter -1 . For a member specific adjustment, select from the drop-down list the data item containing the member specific adjustment factor.

Accrual Rate Accrual Rate Data Item Enter both the numerator and the denominator for the rate of accrual where this is the same for all members for this Benefit Slice i.e. for 1/60th accrual enter 1 in the numerator and 60 in the denominator. If the accrual rate varies by member, then leave these two fields blank and this will enable you to enter an Accrual Rate Data Item instead. Select from the drop-down list the data item containing the Member Specific Accrual Rate. The data item should contain the Accrual Rate as a percentage i.e. for 1/60th use 0.01667 . (This might be used when each member has a targeted benefit of 2/3rds over their career but receive a pro-rata amount on earlier exit. The Member Specific Accrual Rate Calculator can be used to calculate such a data item.) The benefit from the Tier will be calculated as the accrual rate (numerator/denominator) times Salary times service. The service would be the period specified on the Benefit Slice, or Accelerated Service Table , or Added Years . When using Accelerated Service Tables or Service Related Accrual Tables , enter the underlying Accrual Rate that applies to all service here. Either the Accelerated Service Table or the Service Related Accrual Table will contain the number of years of the underlying Accrual Rate at each duration. To enter a Fixed Pension, ensure both these and the Salary field above are blank. Accrual Rate Table If the accrual rate varies by age or service then this field can be used instead of Accrual Rate or the Accrual Rate Data Item . Accrual varies by duration of service If the accrual rate varies by service, then the table entered is indexed by the service period defined on the Benefit Slice. Double click to select an HT type table that contains the cumulative Accrual Rate Table. (Note the service defined on the slice is only used to reference the table and not in the Benefit Calculations.) For example, if the accrual rate was 80ths for the first 10 years service and then 60ths thereafter, the table would have 0.1250 at duration 10 (10 \u00d7 1/80) and 0.1417 at duration 11 (10/80 + 1/60). Accrual Varies by age If the accrual rate varies by age, then the table entered is indexed by the member\u2019s age. Double click to select an HX type table that contains the Accrual Rate for each age. The rate at the members age will then be multiplied by the service period defined for the Benefit Slice. For example, if the accrual rate was 80ths before age 40 and 60ths thereafter, the table would hold the value 0.0125 at each age below 40 and 0.0167 at each age above 40. Please note that the Accrual Rate Table can only be applied to service in a single Slice and cannot be applied across Benefit Slices (or Tiers). To value different Accrual Rates across different Slices then consider using the Service Related Accrual Table . Some functionality only available to some users. Related Selecting rate tables Decr Help Rate tables can be selected by any of the following methods: Right-click on the field for a list of appropriate Rate Tables. For a field that will accept more than one type of Rate Table (e.g. Miscellaneous Tables), the list will be restricted to the current Table Type specified in the field \u2013 if you wish to see all allowable Rate Tables, delete the Table Type from the field before clicking; or Double Clicking on the field will produce the Rate Tables form where Rate Tables can be viewed (numerically and graphically) and Rate Tables can be added or edited. A Rate Table can be selected by pressing the Select button or double clicking on the Rate Table description in the tree; or the list of allowable Rate Tables can be scrolled through by pressing the < or > keys. The description of the Rate Table to the right of the field will change as each new Table is selected. Accelerated Service Table If the service granted for each year of accrual is greater than actual service then this field can be used to determine the service credit. Double click to select an ET type table containing the cumulative service credit that will be indexed by the period of service defined on the Benefit Slice. The corresponding value in the ET table will be used in the Benefit Calculations. (Part years will be linearly interpolated.) For example, a member receives an additional 5 years pensionable service on completion of 10 years. The ET table would have an entry of 9 at duration 9 and 15 at duration 10, 16 at 11 etc. The Accelerated Service Table should not be used with a maximum service restriction but instead the maximum service should be contained within the Table used. Please note that the Accelerated Service Table can only be applied to service in a single Slice and cannot be applied across Benefit Slices (or Tiers). To value different Accrual Rates across different Slices then consider using the Service Related Accrual Table . Some functionality is only available to some users. Related Selecting rate tables Service Related Accrual Table This is ET , FT , GT and HT type rate tables, which is indexed by the period of service specified by the Benefit Slice. It is the corresponding entry on the ET , FT , GT and HT table that is used in the benefit calculation. The service period is calculated from DOE Qualifying Service to the start date/end date on the slice. SuperVal will then linearly interpolate to obtain the value for the member\u2019s exact period of service. Typical uses for this table may be uplifted service or extra years of service granted after a certain period. For example, suppose that members receive a further 5 years pensionable service on completion of 10 years. The Service Related Accrual Table would have an entry of 9 at duration 9 and 15 at duration 10, 16 at 11 etc. i.e. the table is cumulative. Please note that the Service Related Accrual Table will be applied across Benefit Slices (or Tiers). If a ET , FT , GT and HT table is not defined, then the service will be the period between the Start Date (or minimum start date) and Finish Date (or maximum finish date) for the Benefit Slice. Allowance would be made for maximum service. Double click to select from the list of available ET , FT , GT and HT type rate tables. When using this field, you will be required to enter the date from which service starts to accrue in the DOE Qualifying Service on the Membership Tab. Not all functionality is available to all users. Related Selecting rate tables Fixed Pension Select from the drop-down list the data item containing the Fixed Pension Amount. This might have arisen from either a transfer-in or a past service CARE benefit. Increase in Service If the Benefit Basis is CARE, then this pension amount will be increased in service at the CARE Revaluation Rate . If the Benefit Basis is Final Salary, then this pension amount will not be increased in service. (To value a fixed pension that increases in line with salaries, instead consider defining a salary equal to the pension amount and setting up a Slice with an accrual rate of 1/1 multiplied one year of service. Increase in Deferment This pension amount will be increased in deferment at the Revaluation in Deferment Rate specified on the Slices Tab. (The rate chosen will impact on the Early-Retirement Factors that are used.) Note: A Pension Data Item and benefit accrual can be specified in the same Slice as long as they are on different Tiers. Alternatively they can be specified on different Slices. Minimum Pension This field can be used to define a minimum amount of pension that will be provided from this Tier of the particular Slice. This can either be fixed for all members of be member specific. Either enter the amount of the minimum pension or select from the drop-down list the data item containing the member specific data. The amount entered will not be increased by SuperVal between the valuation date and the point of exit ie retirement, withdrawal, death. If no minimum applies then leave this field blank. Maximum Pension This field can be used to define a maximum amount of pension that that will be provided from this Tier of the particular Slice. This can either be fixed for all members of be member specific. Either enter the amount of the maximum pension or select from the drop-down list the data item containing the member specific data. The amount entered will not be increased by SuperVal between the valuation date and the point of exit ie retirement, withdrawal or death. If no maximum applies then leave this field blank. Pension Adjustment Factor A negative or positive loading can be applied to the pension calculated from this Tier of benefits. This loading can either be fixed for all members or be a member specific amount. For a fixed adjustment, enter the number as a multiplier i.e. 1.1 for a 10% increase or 0.9 for a 10% decrease. If no adjustment is required enter 1 . If 0 is entered the liability for this Tier will be zero. To value a negative pension based on the parameters on the Tier, enter -1 . For a member specific adjustment, select from the drop-down list the data item containing the member specific adjustment factor. The pension calculated in this Tier will be multiplied by the data item entered in this field. Deduct Tier 1 Deduct Tier 2 You can deduct the benefits calculated on Tier 1 from either of the benefit calculated on Tier 2 or Tier 3. In Tier 3 you can also deduct the sum of benefits calculated in Tiers 1 and 2. Check these boxes to determine which of the Tiers are deducted. Typical use of this field is for a greater-of benefit comparison. For example, suppose a scheme provides a benefit which is the greater of \\frac{Service \\times Salary}{80} \\frac{Service \\times Salary}{80} and \\frac{Service \\times (Salary - LEL)}{60} \\frac{Service \\times (Salary - LEL)}{60} . Two salaries have been defined in the Salary Tab i.e. Salary1 is Salary with no deduction and Salary2 is Salary with a LEL deduction. The benefits on Tier 1 will be set up to define the 1/80ths benefit. The benefits on Tier 2 will be set up to define the excess of the 1/60th benefit over the 1/80th benefit where this is greater than 0. Specify the 1/60th benefit on Tier 2 then check the box to deduct Tier 1. Also ensure that the Minimum Pension specified is zero. (This will ensure the excess is only valued where greater than zero.) The total benefit valued by the Tiers will be: 1/80ths + Max (1/60ths \u2013 1/80ths, 0) multiplied by the respective salaries and service. Male PPF Adjustment Factor Female PPF Adjustment Factor A negative or positive loading can be applied to the pension calculated from this Tier of benefits on a PPF valuation. This loading can either be fixed for all members or be a member specific amount. For a fixed adjustment, enter the number as a multiplier i.e. 1.1 for a 10% increase or 0.9 for a 10% decrease. If no adjustment is required enter 1 . If 0 is entered the liability for this Tier will be zero. To value a negative pension based on the parameters on the Tier, enter -1 .

Guarantee Period (years) Enter the period for which the member\u2019s pension is guaranteed to be paid irrespective of whether the member survives this period. For a 5 years post retirement guarantee enter 5 . If no guarantee is payable enter 0 . For Pensioners the remaining years guarantee period will be calculated using the member\u2019s standard data item DPC - Date Pension Commenced . Overlap during Guarantee Period If the member\u2019s pension is guaranteed, then the option to select how the guarantee is paid becomes available. Check this box if, on the member\u2019s death during the guarantee period, all outstanding payments in the guarantee period are paid as a lump sum at death and any spouse\u2019s reversion becomes payable immediately. When valuing Actives or Deferreds or using the annuity calculators, the option to select whether this benefit is discounted or undiscounted becomes available. For Pensioners, the lump sum is calculated as the sum of the undiscounted payments at the point of death when this option is selected. Leave this box unchecked if, on the member\u2019s death during the guarantee period, payments continue until the end of the guarantee period and any spouse\u2019s reversion becomes payable thereafter. Payments are always discounted in this scenario. Discounted LS on Death in Guarantee Period The field is used to specify whether the Lump Sum paid as a result of a guarantee after death is discounted or undiscounted for Actives, Deferreds and the Annuity Calculator. Check this box to discount, with interest, the lump sum payable. Leave this box unchecked if the lump sum payable is undiscounted. Deferment Age The age to which the commencement of any annuity payments are deferred in years and months (expressed in terms of the age of the primary annuitant). This will be after the start age for the annuitant. Ceasing Age The age at which annuity payments will cease in years and months (expressed in terms of the age of the primary annuitant). The maximum allowable age of 120 will include payments for the life of the primary annuitant (and reversionary payments, if any, for the life of the reversionary annuitant). Payment Frequency Select from the drop-down list the frequency of the pension payments. The options are: Annual Semi-Annual Quarterly Monthly Lunar-Monthly Fortnightly Weekly Continuous Payment Mode Select from the drop-down list the timing of pension payments.

Spouse's Reversion Enter the reversion payable to the spouse (if any) expressed as a percentage of the member\u2019s annuity. Reversion payable to Spouse on Death in Deferment If there is a deferment period, check the box to include in the calculation a reversionary annuity payable to the spouse on the death of the member during that deferment period.

The description of the Rate Table to the right of the field will change as each new Table is selected. Age Rating Any Rate Table can be rated up or down by a number of years as required to make the rate at every age lighter or heavier than in the original table. A value of +10 will result, for example, in the value selected for a 30 year old actually being the rate for a 40 year old and for a value of -5 would mean that the value at age 25 is selected.

Franking Code For Actives and Deferred Members, there are five choices for Franking of GMPs for members retiring before SPA. For Pensioners only the first three options are available. Select from the drop-down list which of these to apply. The options are: None Partial Franking Full Franking Maximum Franking No Anti Franking Guarantee An example to illustrate how these different options work is set out below: Suppose you have a male member retiring at 60 with a pension as follows: Pension = \u00a32,000 GMP at 60 = \u00a31,000 (included in above figure) GMP at 65 = \u00a31,500 GMP revaluations between 60 and 65 are therefore \u00a3500 (\u00a31,500 less \u00a31,000). Once in payment, the pension will increase at 5% per annum. The additional pension at SPA for the GMP revaluations between 60 and 65 under each of the options are as follows: None All of the revaluations on the GMP are added to the pension at SPA. So, the pension at 65 is calculated as \u00a32,000 \\times 1.05^5 + \u00a3500 = \u00a33,053 \u00a32,000 \\times 1.05^5 + \u00a3500 = \u00a33,053 Partial Franking Revaluations on the GMP between retirement and SPA, less scheme increases granted on the GMP, are added to the pension at SPA. So, the pension at 65 is calculated as \u00a32,000 \\times 1.05^5 + \\left[ 500 \u2013 1,000 \\times \\left( 1.05^5 \u2013 1 \\right) \\right] = \u00a32,776 \u00a32,000 \\times 1.05^5 + \\left[ 500 \u2013 1,000 \\times \\left( 1.05^5 \u2013 1 \\right) \\right] = \u00a32,776 Note that the difference between the GMP revaluations and scheme increases on the GMP can not be used to reduce the pension payable ie the item in square brackets cannot be negative. Full Franking All of the increases on the pension between retirement and SPA are franked against revaluation on the GMP. So, the pension at 65 is calculated as \u00a32,000 \\times 1.05^5 + \\left[ 500 - 2,000 \\times \\left( 1.05^5 \u2013 1 \\right) \\right] = \u00a32,553 \u00a32,000 \\times 1.05^5 + \\left[ 500 - 2,000 \\times \\left( 1.05^5 \u2013 1 \\right) \\right] = \u00a32,553 Note that the difference between the GMP revaluations and scheme increases on the whole pension can not be used to reduce the pension payable i.e. the item in square brackets cannot be negative. Maximum This option differs from Full Franking only if you have an early retirement decrement in your basis. For the early retirements the calculation assumes there is No Anti-Franking guarantee. So the pension at 65 is calculated as \u00a32,000 \\times 1.05^5 = \u00a32,553 \u00a32,000 \\times 1.05^5 = \u00a32,553 For the normal retirement the calculation assumes Full Franking. So the pension at 65 is calculated as \u00a32,000 \\times 1.05^5 + \\left[ 500 \u2013 2,000 \\times \\left( 1.05^5 \u2013 1 \\right) \\right] = \u00a32,553 \u00a32,000 \\times 1.05^5 + \\left[ 500 \u2013 2,000 \\times \\left( 1.05^5 \u2013 1 \\right) \\right] = \u00a32,553 Note that the difference between the GMP revaluations and scheme increases on the whole pension can not be used to reduce the pension payable i.e. the item in square brackets cannot be negative. No Anti Franking Guarantee No antifranking guarantee is made at SPA. So, the pension at 65 is calculated as \u00a32,000 \\times 1.05^5 = \u00a32,553 \u00a32,000 \\times 1.05^5 = \u00a32,553 Male PPF NRA Female PPF NRA On the Legislation Tab, enter the NRA to be attached to the GMP, which is converted in to excess pension, for PPF valuations. Elsewhere, for Actives and Deferreds, select from the drop-down list which of the previously defined PPF NRAs applies to the pension or benefit slice. The PPF NRAs are specified on the PPF/Cap Tab. For Pensioners enter the normal retirement age to be used as the PPF NRA in the PPF (S179 Levy) Valuation. The PPF NRAs are only used to determine the level of capping required. They do not override the Benefit Commencing Age. To allow for ill health retirements, use a sufficiently low age so that all members exceed this age i.e. 16. To allow for early retirement pensions, use an age such as 50. Pre 1988 Total Pseudo Amounts at Retirement This field is only required if Use Approximate GMP Ratio is checked.

Select from the drop-down list the data item containing the total Pre-1988 GMP underlying the pension at Valuation Date for members who have not yet reached SPA. This will enable the correct adjustment (subject to Franking Code) to be made at SPA. This GMP can be different from the standard GMP data items (GMP0 and GMPE0). For example, a member who retires from deferred status before SPA where the GMP revaluations from date of leaving are not payable until SPA. Pre 1988 GMP Adjustment Factor A negative or positive loading can be applied to the Pre-1988 GMP. The entered adjustment is applied to the standard data item.

Cash Sum or Pension Select from the drop-down list how to value the benefit. The options are: Cash Pension Pension Amount Select from the drop-down list the data item to be valued. Spouse's Reversion % This field is used in the Pensioners Module to determine both the proportion of the member\u2019s pension payable on death after retirement and death in deferment. Input the spouse\u2019s reversion factor as a percentage i.e. for 50% enter 50 rather than 0.5 . If the pension is a single life pension then this parameter should be set to 0%. If the spouse\u2019s pension varies by member, this field should be left blank, and the relevant data item entered into Spouse\u2019s Pension Amount . Spouse's Pension Amount If the spouse\u2019s pension varies by member then select from the drop-down list the data item containing the amount of the spouse\u2019s pension. If the spouse\u2019s pension is an identical percentage of the member\u2019s pension for all members then leave this field blank and enter the percentage in the Spouse\u2019s Reversion field. Adjustment Factor A negative or positive loading can be applied to the pension data item. Enter the number as a multiplier i.e. 1.1 for a 10% increase or 0.9 for a 10% decrease. If no adjustment is required enter 1 . If 0 is entered the liability for the pension will be zero. This field can be used to allow for any contingencies, such as children\u2019s pensions, which are not valued by SuperVal. Benefit Commencing Age This is used to defer the start date of a pension until a point in the future. Enter the age at which the pension will commence. For example, a pension may become payable from SPA. In this case SPA would be the Benefit Commencing Age. Any remaining guarantee period calculated is based solely on the data contained in the data item Date Pension Commenced and not on the age entered here. To value an immediate pension either leave blank or enter 0 . Pension Ceasing Age This can be used to stop payment of a pension early. Enter the age at which the member\u2019s or spouse\u2019s pension payments will cease. For example, a temporary pension may be payable between retirement age and SPA. In this case SPA would be the Benefit Ceasing Age. Enter 120 if the pension is payable for life. (This represents the end of the mortality table.) Payable on Death in Deferment If the Benefit Commencing Age is set, the user can specify whether or not a benefit is paid on death prior to this age. Check this box if this benefit is payable on death in deferment. Leave the box unchecked if no benefit is payable. Revaluation in Deferment If the Benefit Commencing Age is set, this is the rate at which the pension will increase between date of valuation and Benefit Commencing Age. Select from the drop-down list the Global Financial Parameter that contains the rate applicable. Once selected, the current value of the Global Financial Parameter is shown to the right of this field. To add a new Global Financial Parameter use the Edit Scheme Financials button at the bottom of this Tab. Pension Increases in Payment This is the rate at which the pension will increase in payment. Select from the drop-down list the Global Financial Parameter that contains the rate applicable. Once selected, the current value of the Global Financial Parameter is shown to the right of this field. To add a new Global Financial Parameter use the Edit Scheme Financials button at the bottom of this Tab. Pension Increases Only Check this box to value the pension increases on a pension only. This can be used where annuities have been purchased for pensioners but ex-gratia pension increases are paid from the fund. Spouse's Reversion Only Check this box if you wish to value the spouse\u2019s reversion only. This can be used when either the entire member\u2019s pension has been commuted and only the liability for the contingent spouse\u2019s reversion remains or where separate data items are available for the single life and the reversionary pension. Include in Adjustment at SPA/Death This option is only available if the Reduce Pensions at SPA box on the Legislation Tab has been checked. Check this box if the pension defined is to be included in the adjustment when the GMP comes into payment at SPA or Death. The user will then be required to enter the underlying GMP data on which to base these calculations. Pension at Retirement If the option to Reduce Pensions at SPA has been checked enter the data item containing the pension at Date Pension Commenced that corresponds to the current Pension Data Item being valued. This is used to determine the pension increases given on the pension since retirement for (full) franking of GMP revaluations at SPA or death. Pre 1988 Included at Retirement If the option to Reduce Pensions at SPA has been checked, and you are not using the Use Approximate GMP Ratio option, enter the data item containing the Pre-1988 GMP at retirement underlying the current Pension Data Item being valued. If the data is not available, then check the Use Approximate GMP Ratio box on the Legislation Tab. However data items containing the total GMP included in the pensions at Valuation Date and Retirement Date will still be required. The member may have left active service before retiring and not yet reached SPA. Therefore the GMP included in the pension may not yet include revaluation from date of leaving. Post 1988 Included at Retirement If the option to Reduce Pension at SPA has been checked, and you are not using the Use Approximate GMP Ratio option, then enter the data item containing the Post-1988 GMP at retirement underlying the current Pension Data Item being valued. If the data is not available, then check the Use Approximate GMP Ratio box on the Legislation Tab. However data items containing the total GMP included in the pensions at Valuation Date and Retirement Date will still be required. The member may have left active service before retiring and not yet reached SPA. Therefore the GMP included in the pension may not yet include any revaluation from date of leaving. Pre 1988 Included at Valuation Date If the option to Reduce Pension at SPA has been checked, and you are not using the Use Approximate GMP Ratio option, then enter the data item containing the Pre-1988 GMP at retirement included in the Pension at Valuation Date for the Pension being valued. If the data is not available, then check the Use Approximate GMP Ratio box on the Legislation Tab. However data items containing the total GMP included in the pensions at Valuation Date and Retirement Date will still be required. The member may have left active service before retiring and not yet reached SPA. Therefore the GMP included in the pension may not yet include any revaluation from date of leaving. Post 1988 Included at Valuation Date If the option to Reduce Pension at SPA has been checked, and you are not using the Use Approximate GMP Ratio option, then enter the data item containing the Post-1988 GMP at retirement included in the Pension at Valuation Date for the Pension being valued. If the data is not available, then check the Use Approximate GMP Ratio box on the Legislation Tab. However data items containing the total GMP included in the pensions at Valuation Date and Retirement Date will still be required. The member may have left active service before retiring and not yet reached SPA. Therefore the GMP included in the pension may not yet include any revaluation from date of leaving. Male PPF NRA Female PPF NRA On the Legislation Tab, enter the NRA to be attached to the GMP, which is converted in to excess pension, for PPF valuations. Elsewhere, for Actives and Deferreds, select from the drop-down list which of the previously defined PPF NRAs applies to the pension or benefit slice. The PPF NRAs are specified on the PPF/Cap Tab. For Pensioners enter the normal retirement age to be used as the PPF NRA in the PPF (S179 Levy) Valuation. The PPF NRAs are only used to determine the level of capping required. They do not override the Benefit Commencing Age. To allow for ill health retirements, use a sufficiently low age so that all members exceed this age i.e. 16. To allow for early retirement pensions, use an age such as 50. PPF Service Period PPF guidance, requires the user to show separately the Pre-1997 pension, post 6 April 1997 to 5 April 2009 pension and the Post 6 April 2009 pension. Select from the drop-down list whether the pension is: Pre-97 97 to 09 Post-09 PPF Revaluation in Deferment This field can be used to override the Revaluation in Deferment specified for deferred pensions in a PPF S179 (Levy) valuation. Select from the dropdown list the Global Financial Parameter that contains the rate applicable. Once selected, the current value of the Global Financial Parameter is shown to the right of this field.

In Edit mode, the list will contain the Rate Table code being edited plus all unused Rate Table codes (of the particular type being added) for selection of the Rate Table code. By selecting a new Rate Table code, a new Rate Table can be created based on the values of an existing Rate Table (or the existing Rate Table can be renamed). Table Description The description of the Rate Table for identification purposes. This description can be modified as required. Edit 1D Rate Tables in a Column format Select this field to edit 1 dimensional rate tables in a column format. This makes copying and pasting of rates quicker. Replace Original Rate Table with New Rate Table When in Edit mode and if a new Rate Table code is selected, you should indicate if the existing Rate Table is to be replaced by the new Rate Table. This enables you to either: create a new Rate Table based on the values of an existing Rate Table (and not replace the existing Rate Table); or rename an existing Rate Table (by replacing the existing Rate Table). Age Rate Duration The values in the Rate Table are displayed and can be modified in the spreadsheet . The range of Rates that can be specified are: pages 0 to 119 for Age-related Rate Tables (including Miscellaneous X-tables) durations 0 to 59 for Duration related Rate Tables (including Miscellaneous T-tables); dimensions of up to 120 values (related to Age (Y-axis) and Duration (X-axis) for decrement rates) for 2-Dimensional Rate Tables (including Miscellaneous M tables); and ages 0 to 119 and durations 0 to {select period +1} for Select Rate Tables. The mortality suffered by an individual member follows a diagonal of the table so the Rates entered at each age (i.e. a row) for a t t -year select period are q[x]:0, q[x-1]:1, q[x-2]:2, ..., q[x-t+1]:t-1, qx{Ultimate} Only one column of Ultimate rates should be specified as all durations beyond t year select period will use the Ultimate rates column. The format of the Rates being entered will depend on the type of Rate Table being entered (an out of range error will be reported if an invalid entry is input). It is necessary to input decimal points. Duration-related 2D tables To determine the age used to look up the factor in Duration-Related Decrement Tables, SuperVal will calculate both the Age Exact and the Age Nearest at the start of the year. If Age Exact is less than Age nearest, SuperVal will use the Age Nearest to look up the decrement at point of exit. If Age Exact is greater than (or equal) to Age Nearest, SuperVal will use the Age Nearest + 1 to look up the decrement at point of exit. To determine the service used to look up the decrement, SuperVal will calculate the period from Date of Entry into Qualifying Service/Start Date for Augmentation Table and anniversary of valuation date +1. Grid Help Right-clicking on a column heading presents a menu with the following options which allow you to expand or reduce the number of columns of data to be entered: Add a new column to the right of the grid; Insert a new column at the position of the cursor; and Delete the current column at the position of the cursor. Grid Help Right-clicking on the Top Left Corner of the grid displays a menu which allows you to set the following Grid Editing Options: Editing of a cell can be invoked by either clicking on the cell or by pressing F2 when the cell is active (Clicking will only change the current active cell); and determine the cursor movement once editing is complete to be either to the next cell down, the next cell to the right or to stay in the current cell. De-Interpolate Rates (2) Use this functionality to create Exact-Age rates (y) from mid-Year rates (x). Exact-Age rates are calculated as follows: y(NRA) = x(NRA) y(NRA) = x(NRA) y(NRA-1) = 2x(NRA) - y(NRA) y(NRA-1) = 2x(NRA) - y(NRA) y(NRA-2) = 2x(NRA-1) - y(NRA-1) y(NRA-2) = 2x(NRA-1) - y(NRA-1) ... Insert Annuities Click the Insert Annuities button to enable the calculation of annuity factors. These values will replace values at the ages specified in the annuity calculation. Delete Rates When Adding or Editing an Age or Duration related Rate Table, pressing the Delete Rates button enables the deletion of rates in a specified range. Insert Rates When Adding or Editing Age or duration related Rate Tables, pressing the Insert Rates button enables the insertion (or replacement) of rates in a range using a vector. Import Rates (Scheme) Pressing the Import Rates button enables importing rates from an ASCII file. The standard Windows dialog box is presented allowing you to select a file containing the rates to be imported. The file can be either a Text file or CSV (Comma Separated Values) file and should contain for Age and Duration related Rate Tables, a series of numbers being alternate values of Age/Duration followed by a Rate (similar to the .TAB export files created by SuperVal) for 2-Dimensional Tables, a series of records containing Rates for each respective Age (or Y-axis dimension). It is not necessary to specify a rate for every Age and/or Duration in the file as the default value will be assumed (one for Duration related tables and zero for all other tables) for any unspecified Ages/Durations. However, the file is assumed to contain Rates for all Ages and/or Durations so all existing rates in the Rate Table are replaced by the imported rates. After accepting the parameters, the effect of the import is displayed for confirmation before the Rate Table is updated.

For actives these are: ERF1 for use with Revaluation Rates in deferments 1 and 3 ERF1 for use with Revaluation Rate 2 ERF2 for use with Revaluation Rates in deferment 1 and 3 ERF2 for use with Revaluation Rate 2 For deferreds these are ERF1 ERF2 Users without Late Retirement Tab The rate table is typically an FX table and should contain non-zero entries for ages at which members are assumed to retire. Please note that SuperVal assumes exits prior to NRA occur half-way through the year ie 0.5 years, 1.5 years etc after the valuation date. Exits at NRA occur at the beginning of the year. This should be reflected in the early retirement reduction factor tables used. Therefore, if the reduction is 4% simple per annum, and the NRA is 65, the table should be defined as follows: Age Rate 65 1.00 64 0.98 63 0.94 62 0.90 Etc. Benefits of members above NRA can be adjusted to reflect late payment by adding a factor in ages above NRA i.e. 1.04 at age 66 for a 4% increase. Please note members above NRA will be assumed to retire at the valuation date. Where this has been left blank, SuperVal will assume an Early-Retirement Factor of 1.

If the Automatic Sex/Category Sub-File Creation box is checked, the user will specify a single file (containing the data for all groups) and then select the sex and category combinations that you wish to be processed (sex/category sub-files will be automatically created). Investigation Data File(s) Investigation Data File Double click to select the filename (or filenames, if appropriate) of the member data files to be processed. Data files may contain inactive members (exits and members who have joined after the valuation date) as well as active members. The file(s) must be in the format specified in the data format. If specification of only one file is allowed, a list of the allowable files specified on the Scheme Details will be presented with a Right Click. Note that any filenames used on that list will be relative value , that is, the filename specified is controlled by the label to the right of the field. If the filename is changed on the Scheme Details then the filename in the saved parameters will also be change. Data Format Double click to select the Format File for the current Data File. The Format File contains the saved parameters specifying the column specification of each of the data items contained in the data file. Data format descriptions are prefixed by an indication of the type of format e.g. <Act> for Actives, <Def> for Deferreds, <Pen> for Pensioners. If you intend to use the GMP Calculators to calculate GMPs after creating your data, ensure that columns are created in your data file for these fields. (In addition, enter dummy data into the data file for the first member that is at least as large as the largest expected GMP for all members.

User may also select a blank category if they do not wish to run that particular category. Calculation Date The Calculation Date to which the investigation is performed. This defaults to the Current Valuation Date. You can overwrite this if you wish as the investigation can be carried out at dates other than the valuation date provided there is sufficient data. Dates can be entered in almost any format and they will be automatically converted to DD/MM/YYYY format. Start Age The Start Age is the minimum age at which investigation results will be output to the file (or in the review of the investigation, the graphical display). Note that the results for all ages are calculated (and saved). The Start Age can be adjusted when reviewing the investigation results. End Age The End Age is the maximum age at which investigation results will be output to the file (or in the review of the investigation, the graphical display). It is rounded to the next highest multiple of the Grouping of Data factor from the Start Age. Note that the results for all ages are calculated (and saved). The End Age can be adjusted when reviewing the investigation results. Grouping of Results - Every The Grouping of Data factor determines the size of the age sub-divisions used to summarise investigation results output to the file (or in the review of the investigation, the graphical display). Note that the results for all ages are calculated (and saved). The Grouping of Data factor can be adjusted when reviewing the investigation results. Salary Definition The analysis or investigation of the active membership data may be based on either the Current or Previous Salary. Investigate Only Entrants between The cohort of members to be investigated can be controlled by specifying two dates between which members must have joined to be included for investigation. A date of 01/01/1901 and the Current Valuation Date as specified initially. This would include all members active at the Current Valuation Date in the investigation. Dates can be entered in almost any format and they will be automatically converted to DD/MM/YYYY format. If your data records do not contain either of the joining dates, all members are investigated irrespective of these parameters. These parameters enable: investigation of the promotional salary scale durationally; or to investigate, for example, only members who were in-force at the previous valuation date. Pairs of Snapshot Salary investigation runs can be carried out to produce some comparable averages over the inter-valuation period. To determine the increase in Average Scheme Salary over the inter-valuation period (increases due to inflation only) compare the averages from: Investigate members joining between 01/01/1901 and the Current Valuation Date based on Current Salary with a Calculation Date of the Current Valuation Date. Investigate members joining between 01/01/1901 and the Previous Valuation Date based on Previous Salary with a Calculation Date of the Previous Valuation Date. To determine the increase in Average Salary for members in-force throughout the inter-valuation period (increases due to inflation and promotion) compare the averages from: Investigate members joining between 01/01/1901 and the Previous Valuation Date based on Current Salary with a Calculation Date of the Current Valuation Date. Investigate members joining between 01/01/1901 and the Previous Valuation Date based on Previous Salary with a Calculation Date of the Current Valuation Date. Based on Date of Joining The (service) duration ranges specified are calculated according to the selection in this field and the Calculation Date . Check the box to select either based on Date of joining Company or Date of joining Scheme. The data will be taken from the standard data items, Save the Results for Sub Groups The results (for all files or sub-groups combined) of every investigation are always saved (to a saved results file). These results are stored using the description applied to the parameter set when saved. This option allows you to also save the results for each of the files or sub-groups specified as well. These results are stored using the description of the saved parameter set with a suffix of the sub-group data filename. Stored results for each of the sub-groups means that: males and females can be investigated simultaneously but separate results can be reviewed; and/or the appropriateness of the Rate Table found to be the best fit for the whole group can be checked against each of the sub-groups. It is possible to delete stored investigation results when reviewing the investigation. It is recommended that any results for inappropriate groupings such as heterogeneous groups (eg males and females combined when the decrement should clearly be different) or any small groups (for which comparisons are not reliable) or for any runs containing erroneous data should be deleted to avoid possible error. Expected Table The Rate Table Code of the expected table for comparison with the actual Scheme experience. The starting point for the comparison table is generally the expected table that was assumed at the previous investigation. Related Selecting rate tables Decr Help Rate tables can be selected by any of the following methods: Right-click on the field for a list of appropriate Rate Tables. For a field that will accept more than one type of Rate Table (e.g. Miscellaneous Tables), the list will be restricted to the current Table Type specified in the field \u2013 if you wish to see all allowable Rate Tables, delete the Table Type from the field before clicking; or Double Clicking on the field will produce the Rate Tables form where Rate Tables can be viewed (numerically and graphically) and Rate Tables can be added or edited. A Rate Table can be selected by pressing the Select button or double clicking on the Rate Table description in the tree; or the list of allowable Rate Tables can be scrolled through by pressing the < or > keys. The description of the Rate Table to the right of the field will change as each new Table is selected. Age Rating Any Rate Table can be rated up or down by a number of years as required to make the rate at every age lighter or heavier than in the original table. A value of +10 will result, for example, in the value selected for a 30 year old actually being the rate for a 40 year old and for a value of -5 would mean that the value at age 25 is selected. If an age rating of a fraction of a year is required, a new table will have to be created through the Edit rate table option on the Rate Table form. Percentage Rating A percentage adjustment can be made to either a Rate Table or a Salary. The Rate Tables can be adjusted by a percentage loading to make the decrement rate lighter or heavier than the original table. The salary for new entrants can be loaded to reflect changes in the salary profile. Enter the number as percentage above 100% i.e. if a loading of 110% is required then enter 10 or if a loading of 90% then enter -10 . If no adjustment is required then leave blank.
