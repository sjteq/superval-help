# Count Complete Years

Check this box if exits before NRA should only receive revaluations for
each complete year between valuation date and date of exit. Leave the
box unchecked to allow for the extra half-year revaluation to date of
exit.

Exits before NRA, such as early retirement and death in deferment, are
assumed to occur half-way through the year i.e. 0.5, 1.5, 2.5 years after
the valuation date. By checking this box, these benefits will receive
revaluations for the number of complete years only i.e. 0, 1, 2. If the
box is unchecked, the benefits will receive an additional half-year of
revaluation i.e. 0.5, 1.5, 2.5.

On each of the PUPs, Ind PUPS and NSPUPs Tabs you can choose to override
this entry and use the other approach.
