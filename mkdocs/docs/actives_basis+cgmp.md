# Ignore GMP in Split

This field enables the split between Pre-97 and Post-97 benefit to be
done in the correct proportions. Check this box if SuperVal should
ignore the GMP when calculating cash proportions. Please note that if
this option is chosen then the GMP pension maybe commuted. (This depends
on the options chosen and the size of the GMP.) However, SuperVal will
still pay the whole of the GMP at SPA. This may overstate the liability.
