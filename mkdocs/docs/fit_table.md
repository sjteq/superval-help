# Fit Table



## Rate Tables File Type

Select from the drop-down list which type of rate table to search for a
similar table. The options are:

-   Death Rates (Age-Related Only)
-   Retirement Rates (Age-Related Only)
-   Promotional Salary Scales (Age-Related Only)
-   Ill health Retirement Rates (Age-Related Only)
-   Leaving Service Rates (Age-Related Only)
-   New Entrant Proportions
-   New Entrant Salaries

If selecting `Promotional Salary Scales` then the user will be required
to select the [Salary Scale Type](#fit_table+decrtype).

## Salary Scale Type

When looking at Promotional Salary Scale Tables, select from the
drop-down list, whether the table uses a Rate or an Index.

## Age

SuperVal will show the relevant ages for the table.

## Rate

Enter a selection of ages that are in the table you are trying to match.
SuperVal will require at least 4 entries to try to match a table.
However, the more points of reference you are able to provide, the
better match you are likely to find within the tables.

After selecting OK, SuperVal will provide a list of best fit tables.
SuperVal will provide details of the Table to select and the Age Rating
and Percentage Rating to apply to it. It will then show you details of
the rates that would be used by SuperVal if this table, so adjusted was
selected.

## Grid Help

Right-clicking on a column heading presents a menu with the following
options which allow you to expand or reduce the number of columns of
data to be entered:

-   Add a new column to the right of the grid;
-   Insert a new column at the position of the cursor; and
-   Delete the current column at the position of the cursor.

## Grid Help

Right-clicking on the Top Left Corner of the grid displays a menu which
allows you to set the following Grid Editing Options:

-   Editing of a cell can be invoked by either clicking on the cell or
    by pressing F2 when the cell is active (Clicking will only change
    the current active cell); and
-   determine the cursor movement once editing is complete to be either
    to the next cell down, the next cell to the right or to stay in the
    current cell.

## OK

When you have finished entering the relevant information, click the _OK_
button to move to the next screen.

SuperVal will check that all of the required entries on the page have
been made. If additional fields require data SuperVal will show briefly
in red which is the first of these fields found on the page.

## Cancel

Clicking on the _Cancel_ button allows you to return to the previous
screen without saving any of your changes.
