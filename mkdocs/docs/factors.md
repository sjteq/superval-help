options which allow you to expand or reduce the number of columns of
data to be entered:

    by pressing F2 when the cell is active (Clicking will only change
    the current active cell); and

## Edit

When a Rate Table is highlighted (and you have been given the
appropriate access level), an Edit Button will become enabled.

On pressing the _Edit_ button, the Rate Table (and its Rate Table number
and description) can be modified.

Note that after the _Edit_ button is pressed and until the editing is
completed or aborted, the Rate Table file is locked to stop other users
from making simultaneous changes to this Rate Table file (which may
cause corruption of the file). Thus it is recommended that the shortest
time possible be spent in this mode.

## Add

When a parent node of a group of Rate Tables is highlighted (and you
have been given the appropriate access level), an _Add_ button will become
enabled. This will also be used to add another Factor Table.

On pressing the _Add_ button, the Rate Table number, description and rates
can be specified.

Note that after the _Add_ button is pressed and until the addition is
completed or aborted, the Rate Table file is locked to stop other users
from making simultaneous changes to this Rate Table file (which may
cause corruption of the file). Thus it is recommended that the shortest
time possible be spent in this mode.

## Delete

When a Rate Table or Factor Table is highlighted (and you have been
given the appropriate access level), a Delete Button will become
enabled.

On pressing the _Delete_ button, the Rate Table/Factor Table will, after
confirmation, be deleted.

Note that after the _Delete_ button is pressed and until the deletion is
completed or aborted, the Rate Table file is locked to stop other users
from making simultaneous changes to this Rate Table file (which may
cause corruption of the file). Thus it is recommended that the shortest
time possible be spent in this mode.
