# Pension Benefits Capitalised or Spread

This and the other Cash Flow Parameters only affect the `Cash Flow
Summary` page in the Excel Output/Consolidation Output. They do not have
any effect on the Valuation Results.

Select from the drop-down list the option to use. The options are:

-   Capitalise
-   Spread

If `Capitalise` is selected the output will show the cashflows assuming
the benefits are capitalised at the point of first payment.

If `Spread` is selected the output will show the cashflows as they
become due.

However, the Death in Deferment Liability shown will always be the
capitalised value of the payments. The user can choose the point at
which the Death in Deferment Liability is shown in the Cash Flows
summary in the [Death in Deferment Method](actives_basis+didmethod.md)
field.

In addition, if `Spread` is chosen for Actives or Deferreds, the user
will be required to specify at which point the Underpin Liability is
capitalised in the [Underpin Method](bases+umethod.md).

When running a DAB method valuation, this field must be set to
Capitalise.
