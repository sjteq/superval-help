# Alternative Slices: Guarantee

This field determines whether and how the Alternate Slices apply. Select
from the drop-down list one of the following options:

-   Ignore
-   Maximum
-   Minimum
-   Scale down

If `Ignore` is selected then the Alternate Slices are ignored and only
the (normal) Benefit Slices will be valued.

If `Maximum` is selected then the benefits arising at exit from Benefit
Slices and Alternate Slices are compared and the greater is valued.

If `Minimum` is selected then the benefit arising at exit from Benefit
Slices and Alternate Slices are compared and the lower is valued.

If `Scale Down` is selected then the benefits arising at exit from
Benefit Slices and Alternate Slices are compared. If the benefits on the
Alternate Slices are smaller than the benefits from the Benefit Slices
then the benefit on the Normal Slices is scaled down in proportion.

Not all options are available to all users.
