The Migration Wizard will involve the migration of either the SuperVal
V8.42, SuperVal V8.50 or SuperVal V8.47 Basis Files into the SuperVal
V9.00 Basis Files and the creation of the Global Financial and Mortality
parameters, the PPF parameters and the Contribution parameters in the
new area for Global Parameters.

The Scheme Basis Files to be used for the migration are taken from the
directory selected in the SuperVal/21 Migration Folder. The migration
can be run multiple times and can be used to migrate membership groups
separately or groups of bases together.

The Table below will show the available Basis files that are stored in
the Current Migration Folder. Files for each of the 3 modules are shown
separately. For each of the Basis Files you will be able to see:

-   the previous Basis File Name i.e. the name of the previous parameter
    Basis File
-   the Basis Description i.e. the category description
-   the Version of SuperVal that the Basis File was created in
-   the latest Save Time of the Basis File.

Click to select which of the Basis Files you wish to migrate. To
unselect all Basis Files in a category click on the empty line below the
bottom category within the Basis File.

## Basis File Names to mirror those used in Superval/21

Check this box if the migrated Basis File names in V9.00 should be the
same as those used in previous versions of SuperVal. Leave unchecked if
you wish to re-name the Basis Files in V9.00.

## Basis File Name

If you have chosen not to use the same basis file names in V9.00 then
enter here the Basis File Name to use here.
