## Deferreds Data File

Double click to select the member data file containing the member data
for the particular class of membership i.e. active, deferred or pensioner.
The data file will have been created via _Data&gt;Data Build_ and will
have a ` extension. The data file will be found in the Input Folder.

## Data Format

Double click to select the Format File for the current Data File. The
Format File contains the saved parameters specifying the column
specification of each of the data items contained in the data file. Data
format descriptions are prefixed by an indication of the type of format
e.g. &lt;Act&gt; for Actives, &lt;Def&gt; for Deferreds, &lt;Pen&gt; for Pensioners.

If you intend to use the GMP Calculators to calculate GMPs after
creating your data, ensure that columns are created in your data file
for these fields. (In addition, enter dummy data into the data file for
the first member that is at least as large as the largest expected GMP
for all members. This will ensure that the Format created leaves
sufficient space for the GMPs calculated.)

## Data&gt;Build

If you have created data using _Data&gt;Build_ then the format name will
be the same as the original source (CSV) file.

## BasisModule&gt;Migrate

If you have migrated your data files from earlier versions the name will
be unchanged.

_Ignoring all changes_. If you click _Yes_, the file will be closed
without saving any changes. If you click _No_ you will be returned to your
original screen.

From the Browser, the _Quit_ button will take you to a graphical display
of the results.
