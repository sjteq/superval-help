# Set Font



## Font Style

Select the style of font required for display purposes only. As most
files used in SuperVal are arranged in columns, it is recommended to
select a font style that is non-proportional (that is, all characters
are the same size).

## Font Size

Select the size of the font required for display purposes only. The size
will be a compromise between being able to easily read the text and
maximising the amount of the page that is visible at one time.

## OK

When you have finished entering the relevant information, click the _OK_
button to move to the next screen.

SuperVal will check that all of the required entries on the page have
been made. If additional fields require data SuperVal will show briefly
in red which is the first of these fields found on the page.

## Cancel

Clicking on the _Cancel_ button allows you to return to the previous
screen without saving any of your changes.
