# Migration Names: Actives



## Field Description

## Migration Name

The purpose of the Migration Names Table is to enable the user to
provide consistent pointer names for each of the different Global
Parameters created in SuperVal V9.00 as part of the Migration Process. A
Migration Table can also be imported from different Input Folders to
enable a consistent approach to be taken across different schemes and
input folders.

For each of the different assumptions and for each of the three
Membership Groups the user should enter the pointer name that should be
used. For example, to label all of the pre retirement interest rates
PreInt 1, PreInt 2 etc then enter `PreInt` as the Migration Name for _Pre
Retirement Interest_ where appropriate. The Migration Name should not be
longer than 40 characters and can contain spaces.

When migrating the Basis Files, select the appropriate Migration Table
and click _Next_. The migration process will label the pointers for the
assumptions appropriately.

## Grid Help

Right-clicking on a column heading presents a menu with the following
options which allow you to expand or reduce the number of columns of
data to be entered:

-   Add a new column to the right of the grid;
-   Insert a new column at the position of the cursor; and
-   Delete the current column at the position of the cursor.

## Grid Help

Right-clicking on the Top Left Corner of the grid displays a menu which
allows you to set the following Grid Editing Options:

-   Editing of a cell can be invoked by either clicking on the cell or
    by pressing F2 when the cell is active (Clicking will only change
    the current active cell); and
-   determine the cursor movement once editing is complete to be either
    to the next cell down, the next cell to the right or to stay in the
    current cell.
