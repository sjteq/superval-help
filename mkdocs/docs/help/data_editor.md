# Data Editor



## Member Data File

Double click to select the DAT file containing the data that you wish to
edit.

## Data Format

Double click to select the Format File for the current Data File. The
Format File contains the saved parameters specifying the column
specification of each of the data items contained in the data file. Data
format descriptions are prefixed by an indication of the type of format
e.g. &lt;Act&gt; for Actives, &lt;Def&gt; for Deferreds, &lt;Pen&gt; for Pensioners.

If you intend to use the GMP Calculators to calculate GMPs after
creating your data, ensure that columns are created in your data file
for these fields. (In addition, enter dummy data into the data file for
the first member that is at least as large as the largest expected GMP
for all members. This will ensure that the Format created leaves
sufficient space for the GMPs calculated.)

## Data&gt;Build

If you have created data using _Data&gt;Build_ then the format name will
be the same as the original source (CSV) file.

## BasisModule&gt;Migrate

If you have migrated your data files from earlier versions the name will
be unchanged.

displayed in the Information frame at the bottom of the form:

-   details of the type, width and position of the current data field;
-   the frequency of salary and pension data fields;
-   the current page and Record number (these can be edited to move
    about the file);
-   the currently tagged Records or blocked cells (it is not possible to
    have both tagged Records and blocked cells at the same time); and
-   the current search string.

## Cancel

When in Edit mode, the _Cancel_ button can be used to ignore all changes
made to the data file (since entering Edit mode or the last time that
_Save_ or _Save As_ was pressed).

## Save

When in Edit mode, only one of the _Save_ or _Save As_ buttons will be
displayed.

To save over the existing file, click the _Save_ button.

To save to a new file name, amend the file name in the Member Data File
box and the _Save As_ button will become available.

The user will remain in Edit mode after pressing either _Save_ or _Save As_.

## Find Next

When in Edit mode and a search string in the Find module has been
found, the _Find Next_ button will be displayed to enable movement to
the next occurrence. The F3 key can also be used, if preferred.

## Data Notes

Click to show any Data Notes. If no Data Notes are contained in the file
this button will not be enabled.

## Edit

The _Edit_ button is used to select the data file and data format and move
into Edit mode.

## Quit

Clicking on the _Quit_ button allows you to exit without saving any of
your changes.

In some of the screens you will be asked to confirm if you want to exit
_Ignoring all changes_. If you click _Yes_, the file will be closed
without saving any changes. If you click _No_ you will be returned to your
original screen.

From the Browser, the _Quit_ button will take you to a graphical display
of the results.
