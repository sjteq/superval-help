# Date Left Active

If [Fixed Revaluation Rate to SPA](deferreds_basis+gmprev2.md) has been
selected, then select from the drop-down list the data item containing
the date the member left active service.

For Deferreds, the date that members left active service is NOT a
standard data item but a user defined item (prefixed with a `q`). The
standard data item `DOE` will contain the date of exit from deferred
status i.e. transfer out, retirement, death.
