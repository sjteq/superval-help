# Fix File



## Input Data File

Specify the input data file (or files, if appropriate). It must be
located in the Scheme Folder.

Double Clicking will activate the standard Windows Open File Dialog
box for selection of a file.

## Input Data Type

Select from the drop-down list the type of Input Data File you are
using. (This will be used to determine the character used in the last
column of the file.)

## Fixed Input Data File

Specify a name for the data file. The filename specified must not
already exist as it will not overwrite an existing file. It will be
created in the Scheme Folder.

Double Clicking will activate the standard Windows Open File Dialog
box for selection of a file (which can be used as a `starting point` for
the name of the file).

## Delete Multiple Blank Columns

Check this box if you wish to remove multiple blank columns from the
file.

The aim is to leave only one blank column between each column of data
(simply to make the file more compact).

## Limit Number of Records in Fixed File

Specify the number of records to be included in the `fixed` file. Leave
blank if you wish all records to be included in the `fixed` file.

This feature can be used to either:

-   create a test data file with only a few records used for testing
    the results of some calculations; or
-   remove any unwanted records added by the Fixing program by
    specifying the expected number of records in the file. (The Fixing
    program will add another record if any characters (which may be only
    end of file markers) are found beyond the last record.)

## Run

Click the _Run_ button to run the calculations.

## Save

Clicking on the _Save_ button allows you to save the entries.

## Quit

Clicking on the _Quit_ button allows you to exit without saving any of
your changes.

In some of the screens you will be asked to confirm if you want to exit
_Ignoring all changes_. If you click _Yes_, the file will be closed
without saving any changes. If you click _No_ you will be returned to your
original screen.

From the Browser, the _Quit_ button will take you to a graphical display
of the results.
