# Import Ranges



## Saved Parameter Sets

The Import Validation Ranges allows Users to copy ranges used previously
for the Membership class. So if you have previously set up Validation
Ranges for running Data Validation, these can be copied as the starting
point for current Validation Ranges. e.g. 

-   `Data Build Actives 2018.csv`, set Validation ranges when validating 
-   `Data Build Actives 2019.csv`, copy Validation Ranges used in Data Build of `Actives 2018.csv` avoiding replication of setting Validation Ranges again, as `Actives 2018.csv` and `Actives 2019.csv` will usually have the same user-defined fields.

## OK

When you have finished entering the relevant information, click the _OK_
button to move to the next screen.

SuperVal will check that all of the required entries on the page have
been made. If additional fields require data SuperVal will show briefly
in red which is the first of these fields found on the page.

## Cancel

Clicking on the _Cancel_ button allows you to return to the previous
screen without saving any of your changes.
