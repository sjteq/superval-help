## Grid Help

Right-clicking on a column heading presents a menu with the following
options which allow you to expand or reduce the number of columns of
data to be entered:

-   Add a new column to the right of the grid;
-   Insert a new column at the position of the cursor; and
-   Delete the current column at the position of the cursor.

## Grid Help

Right-clicking on the Top Left Corner of the grid displays a menu which
allows you to set the following Grid Editing Options:

-   Editing of a cell can be invoked by either clicking on the cell or
    by pressing F2 when the cell is active (Clicking will only change
    the current active cell); and
-   determine the cursor movement once editing is complete to be either
    to the next cell down, the next cell to the right or to stay in the
    current cell.

In some of the screens you will be asked to confirm if you want to exit

original screen.

From the Browser, the _Quit_ button will take you to a graphical display
