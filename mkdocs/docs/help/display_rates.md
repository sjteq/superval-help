The values of the Rate Table are displayed in a &lsqio;spreadsheetâ€™.

If you were in the Import Rates, Insert Rates, Delete Rates or Bulk
Annuities module, these rates are displayed for purposes of confirming
acceptance of the changes. Any changes made to the Rate Table (for
example, overwritten values or inserted values) will be coloured to
assist the recognition of the changes being made.

The range of Rates displayed are:

-   ages 0 to 119 for Age related Rate Tables (including Miscellaneous
    X-tables);
-   durations 0 to 59 for Duration related Rate Tables (including
    Miscellaneous T-tables); and
-   dimensions (related to Age (Y-axis) and Duration (X-axis) for
    decrement rates) of 120 values for 2-Dimensional Rate Tables
    (including Miscellaneous M tables).

## Grid Help

Right-clicking on a column heading presents a menu with the following
options which allow you to expand or reduce the number of columns of
data to be entered:

-   Add a new column to the right of the grid;
-   Insert a new column at the position of the cursor; and
-   Delete the current column at the position of the cursor.

## Grid Help

Right-clicking on the Top Left Corner of the grid displays a menu which
allows you to set the following Grid Editing Options:

-   Editing of a cell can be invoked by either clicking on the cell or
    by pressing F2 when the cell is active (Clicking will only change
    the current active cell); and
-   determine the cursor movement once editing is complete to be either
    to the next cell down, the next cell to the right or to stay in the
    current cell.
