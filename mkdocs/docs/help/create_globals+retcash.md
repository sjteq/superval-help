# Create Globals: RetCash



## Retirement Cash Assumptions

The Create Globals Wizard will show the structure of pointers and the
values that will be created for each of the Global Assumptions.  
Under each pointer will be a list of all the categories where it will be
used.  
   
If required, the pointer names can amended, cloned or deleted via the
Right Click Menu. Equiniti recommends that the user ensures all names
and descriptions are generic  so that if the value of the assumption
changes in future the pointer name is still valid.

To amend the pointer name, click once slowly and a box will appear
around the existing name. This can then be changed. 

To clone a pointer, right click once on the pointer you wish to clone.
This can then be renamed. Any existing Global Variables that should be
underneath this pointer can be moved using click and drag.

To delete a pointer, right click and select delete. This option is only
available if there are no variables using this pointer.  
The user should also ensure that the pointers established are a true and
accurate reflection of all the different possible assumptions required
to value the scheme going forward. In particular; taking care to set up
separate pointers for assumptions that by co-incidence were the same at
the previous valuation but may not be at future valuations.
