# Roll Forward: Changes



## New Members Data File

Double click to select the filename (or filenames, if appropriate) of
the member data files to be processed.

Data files may contain inactive members (exits and members who have
joined after the valuation date) as well as active members.

The file(s) must be in the format specified in the data format.

If specification of only one file is allowed, a list of the allowable
files specified on the Scheme Details will be presented with a Right
Click. Note that any filenames used on that list will be `relative
value`, that is, the filename specified is controlled by the label to
the right of the field. If the filename is changed on the Scheme Details
then the filename in the saved parameters will also be change.

## New Members Data Format

Double click to select the Format File for the current Data File. The
Format File contains the saved parameters specifying the column
specification of each of the data items contained in the data file. Data
format descriptions are prefixed by an indication of the type of format
e.g. &lt;Act&gt; for Actives, &lt;Def&gt; for Deferreds, &lt;Pen&gt; for Pensioners.

If you intend to use the GMP Calculators to calculate GMPs after
creating your data, ensure that columns are created in your data file
for these fields. (In addition, enter dummy data into the data file for
the first member that is at least as large as the largest expected GMP
for all members. This will ensure that the Format created leaves
sufficient space for the GMPs calculated.)

## Data&gt;Build

If you have created data using _Data&gt;Build_ then the format name will
be the same as the original source (CSV) file.

## BasisModule&gt;Migrate

If you have migrated your data files from earlier versions the name will
be unchanged.
