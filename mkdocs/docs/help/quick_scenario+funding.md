Scenario Modeller on i.e. the _original_ results in the graphs /
output.

## Consolidation SQL Server Database

Select the consolidation SQL server database file to be used for QSM

## Type of Graph

The default is _liabilities_. Choose to view one of the following 7
options:  

-   Liabilities – these are split into membership groups (actives / deferreds / pensioners) and      past and future service
-   Waterfall Liabilities  
-   Financial Position  
-   Waterfall Financial Position  
-   Cash Flows  
-   Employer Contributions  
-   Employer Funding Rate

## Term

The term displayed for the cashflows i.e.in the graphs _Cash Flows_,
_Employer Contributions_ and _Employer Funding Rate_ can be adjusted
here to display the results for the term required.

## Membership Groups

Membership Groups  

Select from:  

-   All
-   Active
-   Deferred
-   Pensioner
-   Active / Deferred
-   Deferred / Pensioner
-   Active / Pensioner

## Contributions

Contributions checkbox appears as an option if employee contributions
have been included   
within the Actives basis. These will then be included within the
cashflow graphs / output.

## Expenses

Expenses checkbox appears as an option if expenses have been included
when running the consolidation. These will then be included within the
cashflow graphs / output.

## Additional Liabilities

Additional Liabilities checkbox appears if additional liabilities have
been included when running the consolidation.  These will then be
included within the cashflow graphs / output.

## Adjust Future Service Funding Rate

If _Adjust Future Service Funding Rate_ boxed is ticked then the
employer future service funding rate is adjusted to allow for the
changes in assumptions. The impact of this can be seen in the graphs
_Employer Contributions_ and _Employer Funding Rate_.

## Control Period

If _Adjust Future Service Funding Rate_ boxed is ticked then the control
period can be changed; the impact on the employer future service funding
rate can then be seen in the graphs _Employer Contributions_ and
_Employer Funding Rate_.

## Amortisation Constant

If amortisation is included within the consolidation file, the rate,
term or amount can be kept constant.  

The field chosen i.e. _First Year Contribution_, _Term_ or _Deficit /
(Surplus) Amortised_ is greyed out and then changing one of the
remaining two alters the other appropriately. For example:  if the term
is kept constant, the rate can then be adjusted and the deficit /
surplus amortised calculated.

## Contribution Rate

If amortisation is included within the consolidation file, the rate,
term or amount can be kept constant.  
The field chosen i.e. _First Year Contribution_, _Term_ or _Deficit /
(Surplus) Amortised_ is greyed out and then changing one of the
remaining two alters the other appropriately. For example:  if the term
is kept constant, the rate can then be adjusted and the deficit /
surplus amortised calculated.

## First Year Contribution &#163;

term or amount can be kept constant.  

The field chosen i.e. _First Year Contribution_, _Term_ or _Deficit /

is kept constant, the rate can then be adjusted and the deficit /
surplus amortised calculated.

term or amount can be kept constant.  
The field chosen i.e. _First Year Contribution_, _Term_ or _Deficit /

remaining two alters the other appropriately. For example:  if the term
is kept constant, the rate can then be adjusted and the deficit /
surplus amortised calculated.

## Deficit/(Surplus) Amortised &#163;

If amortisation is included within the consolidation file, the rate,
term or amount can be kept constant.  
The field chosen i.e. _First Year Contribution_, _Term_ or _Deficit /
(Surplus) Amortised_ is greyed out and then changing one of the
remaining two alters the other appropriately. For example:  if the term
is kept constant, the rate can then be adjusted and the deficit /
surplus amortised calculated.

## Amortisation Method 1

## Amortisation Method 2

If amortisation has been included within the consolidation there is a
choice of four amortisation methods: 

-   Percentage of All Members’ Salaries  
-   Percentage of Current Members’ Salaries  
-   Level Amounts  
-   Fixed Amounts plus Accrued Interest

## Configure Roll-Forward

This contains the:  

-   adjustments to the financials/mortality  
-   original / change in / revised liabilities, split by benefit type  
-   revised cashflows, split into components (e.g. Ret Pen / Ret Cash / Death Pen / Death Cash)

## Amortise Deficit

If amortisation is included when consolidating, then selecting _Amortise
Deficit_ will adjust the amortisation assumptions to amortise any
surplus / deficit.  
  
A new box will appear asking which amortisations are to be included:  
  
-   Both Amortisations  
-   Amortisation 1  
-   Amortisation 2  
  
and which of the two currently variable fields out of rate / term /
amount (one has previously been chosen to be constant) is to change to
amortise the surplus / deficit.  

If _Both Amortisations_ is chosen then a further box _Shared_ will be
displayed with a choice between sharing between the two amortisation
methods equally or proportionally.
