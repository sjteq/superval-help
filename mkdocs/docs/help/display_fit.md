## FittedTables

SuperVal will firstly list the data entered. SuperVal will show a list
of the current tables found in the Rate Table File which have the best
fit to the figures entered. SuperVal will show the Age Rating and
Percentage Rating that should be used with the table and then show the
figures that would be produced for comparison.

## Save

Clicking on the _Save_ button allows you to save the entries.

## Quit

your changes.

In some of the screens you will be asked to confirm if you want to exit
_Ignoring all changes_. If you click _Yes_, the file will be closed
without saving any changes. If you click _No_ you will be returned to your
original screen.

From the Browser, the _Quit_ button will take you to a graphical display
of the results.
