# Scenarios: ValuationData



## Scenario Valuation Date {00/00/0000}

Enter in a scenario valuation date if different from current valuation
date. If left blank, the system uses the current valuation date. For
future valuation dates the system does not adjust the data input and so
users may want to change the data and adjust this in the scenario.

## Financials Assumptions are effective at the Original Valuation Date

Adjust financials if the defined financials are only effective at the
valuation date in the primary basis. For example if the primary basis
has a date of valuation of 31/12/2015 and the Post Retirement Interest
rate is a vector of 4%, 5%, 4.5%, 5.25%, 5%.Â 

If a scenario is set up with a new valuation date of 31/12/2016 and this
option is checked, the system will adjust the Post Retirement Interest
rate skipping the first rate so the adjusted vector is 5%, 4.5%, 5.25%,
5%. If this option is unchecked, the system uses the original vector.

options which allow you to expand or reduce the number of columns of
data to be entered:

-   Insert a new column at the position of the cursor; and
-   Delete the current column at the position of the cursor.

## Grid Help

Right-clicking on the Top Left Corner of the grid displays a menu which
allows you to set the following Grid Editing Options:

-   Editing of a cell can be invoked by either clicking on the cell or
    by pressing F2 when the cell is active (Clicking will only change
    the current active cell); and
-   determine the cursor movement once editing is complete to be either
    to the next cell down, the next cell to the right or to stay in the
    current cell.
