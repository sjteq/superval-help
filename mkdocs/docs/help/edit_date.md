# Edit Date



## Absolute Data Default Value

## OR Period from Valuation Date

Default values for dates data items can be specified as either

-   a fixed (or absolute) date or
-   a period from the Valuation Date expressed in years (a negative
    period indicates a date prior to the Valuation Date).

The relative date avoids the need to change this date every time the
valuation date changes.
