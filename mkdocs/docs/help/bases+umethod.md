# Underpin: Method

This and the other Cash Flow Parameters only affect the `Cash Flow
Summary` page in the Excel/Consolidation Output. They do not have any
effect on the Valuation Results.

Where `Spread` has been chosen for the field [Pension Benefits
Capitalised or Spread](bases+capind.md) the Underpin (excess) liability
will be shown as capitalised in the Cash Flow. However you can choose
where this capitalised point will be. The options are:

-   Tables
-   Default

If `Tables` is selected then enter the rate tables applicable on the
events where the Underpin is taking place. These are:

-   Retirement - actives and deferreds
-   Leaving Age - actives
-   Death in Deferment - deferreds

If `Default` is selected then the Underpin (excess) liability will be
capitalised at the payment start point.
