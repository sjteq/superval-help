# Migrate S21PPF: Anomaly



## Anomaly

The PPF Migration Anomalies Report will provide a comparison of all of
the Yields, Caps and Overrides in the PPF Library File that the user has
chosen to migrate with the Yields, Caps and Overrides all ready
contained in the V9.00 PPF Global Parameters.

The user should consider the Anomalies highlighted to determine any
issues arising out of the proposed migration.

Where two different sets of yields are shown at the same date, SuperVal
will show the values in the current Library File and migrate the new
values but will allocate them a secondary key to distinguish them from
assumptions migrated earlier.

If two different values for the Cap are shown at the same date, SuperVal
will keep those values already migrated to V9.00.
