## Audit Selections

This function runs an audit on the currently selected set of Financials.
Users will be able to see date and time stamps for every change made
when the financial set was last saved. The audit file is saved in the
current input folder.

## Select as Current

Where more than one Financial Assumption File exists in the same folder,
the user will have the option to select which one to use.

## Add/Edit Financials

Clicking the _Add/Edit Financials_ button will take you to the area where
the Financial Assumptions can be edited. You will then be able to select
which set of Financial Assumptions you wish to edit.

## Quit

Clicking on the _Quit_ button allows you to exit without saving any of
your changes.

In some of the screens you will be asked to confirm if you want to exit
_Ignoring all changes_. If you click _Yes_, the file will be closed
without saving any changes. If you click _No_ you will be returned to your
original screen.

From the Browser, the _Quit_ button will take you to a graphical display
of the results.
