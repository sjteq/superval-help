will be compared to the ones shown in the section below.

## File2

User can select more than one rate table to either add/replace or ignore
it.

## View Tables

Clicking the _View Tables_ button takes you to a screen that compares the
two Rate Tables with the same name.

Firstly, select the Rate Table that you wish to compare. Then click and
you will be able to see details of where the Rate Tables differ. These
will be shown in red.

## Replace Selected

Clicking this button will replace the table existing in the primary rate
table with the one from the rate tables being merged.

## Add Selected

using the same lower case decrement table. If the same lower case
decrement table is already in use, it will use the next available lower
case table in the decrement table.

Clicking this button, will keep the rate table existing in the primary
file and ignore the one from the rate table merge file.
