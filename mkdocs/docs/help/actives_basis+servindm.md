# Count Towards Maximum Service

The maximum amount of service at retirement is defined in the
[Retirement Maximum Service/Retirement Maximum Service
Table](actives_basis+srvmax.md) field on the Membership Tab. On each
Slice you can choose whether the service from that Slice should be
included when comparing total service to the Maximum Service. Check this
box if service from this Slice should be included. Leave the box
unchecked if service from this Slice should not be included in the
comparison.

SuperVal will limit the benefits if the total service from all of the
Slices where this box is checked exceeds the Maximum Service specified
on the Membership Tab. The service will be restricted at the point that
it exceeds the maximum i.e. SuperVal will start at the largest Slice
Number on which benefits are defined and work down to Slice 1 (the
future service Slice). The benefits on the Slice where the Maximum
Service is exceeded will be reduced. All Slices with a lower number will
have a zero liability.
