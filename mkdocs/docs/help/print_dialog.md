## Font Style

files used in SuperVal are arranged in columns, it is recommended to
select a font style that is non-proportional (that is, all characters
are the same size).

## Font Size

Select the size of the font required for printing purposes only. The
size should be selected in conjunction with the page width and page
length parameters on the User Preferences form.

## Print

Pressing the _Print_ button will send a print spool file based on the
current print settings.

## Quit

Clicking on the _Quit_ button allows you to exit without saving any of
your changes.

In some of the screens you will be asked to confirm if you want to exit
_Ignoring all changes_. If you click _Yes_, the file will be closed
without saving any changes. If you click _No_ you will be returned to your
original screen.

From the Browser, the _Quit_ button will take you to a graphical display
of the results.
