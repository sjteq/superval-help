# V9Migration: Anomaly



## Anomalies Report

The purpose of the Anomalies Report will be to provide details of any
inconsistencies or anomalies that exist in the basis files being
migrated.

This report starts by comparing the PPF parameters contained in the
migrated PPF Library files with those in the Scheme Basis Files and
identifying any inconsistencies. Some of the information found on the
PPF Tab in the V8.50.03/V8.47.05 basis files has now become part of the
Global Parameters. When migrating multiple basis files the migration
wizard will globalise the information found in the first category
selected for the group of categories being migrated.

The wizard will then identify any corrections it will make to the Scheme
Basis Files and then show where the Pension Increase labels are being
used.

The user should consider the anomalies highlighted to consider the
issues raised i.e. where two different pension increase rates have the
same description for consolidation.
