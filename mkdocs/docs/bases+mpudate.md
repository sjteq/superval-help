# Start Date for Underpin Guarantee

If the Benefits Underpinned box is checked, and for deferreds only the
[Include in Underpin](deferreds_basis+undind.md) on the PUPs is set to
`Split According to Service`, then enter a Start Date for the Underpin
in DD/MM/YYYY format. If the Underpin has always applied simply enter a
date eg 01/01/1900 to ensure that all benefits are compared with the
Underpin.

**Actives** The user should select on each Slice whether or not the
benefits calculated should be compared to the Underpin calculated. The
Start Date for actives will also be used to determine the amount of GMP
to be included in the Underpin comparison. In determining the amount of
GMP included SuperVal will take account of:

-   Pre-88 GMP accruing between 6/4/1978 and 5/4/1988
-   Post-88 GMP accruing between 6/4/1988 and 5/4/1997. (Note 5/4/1997
    will always be used instead of the `Not After Date` on the `Offset
    Slice`.)

**Deferreds** Please note the standard data item `ACW` will always be
used as the value of the underpin fund as at the valuation date. No
other data item can be specified for the underpin for Deferreds.
