# ROC in Service Interest %

This is the rate at which member’s contributions will be increased while
in service. It will only be required if you have selected _Member’s
Contributions_ or _Money Purchase Underpin_ in the [_Return of
Contributions_](actives_basis+disrct.md) field on the Death Cash tab.

Select from the drop-down list the Global Financial Parameter that
contains the rate applicable. Once selected, the current value is shown
to the right of this field.

To add a new Global Financial Parameter use the _Edit Scheme Financials_
button at the bottom of this tab.
