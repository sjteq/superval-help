# Reduce Pensions at SPA

Check this box if the pensions defined on the Pensions Tab will be
reduced at SPA (or earlier death) when the GMP comes into payment. If
this option is selected the [Use Approximate GMP
Ratio](pensioners_basis+gmpsplit.md) check box becomes available. This
can be used to approximate the GMP offset from each of the pensions if
this data is unavailable.

If the GMP data underlying each of the pensions in available then the
user will be required to enter this in the [Pre/Post-1988 Included at
Retirement](pensioners_basis+preret.md) and [Pre/Post Included at
Valuation Date](pensioners_basis+prevd.md).

Leave the box unchecked if there are no GMPs or if the GMPs are to be
paid in addition to the pensions specified on the Pensions Tab.
