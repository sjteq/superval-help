# Consolidation: Amortisation



## Past Service Surplus/Deficit Amortised

## OR Surplus/Deficit Amortised &#163;

The user can specify up to two different amortisation schedules for
either the past service surplus or deficit. Within each schedule the
user can choose one of two different methods of spreading. The options
are:

-   as a percentage of the total
-   as a level amount.

If using the percentage field, enter the percentage of the
surplus/deficit to be amortised.

If using the level amount, enter the amount of surplus/deficit to be
amortised.

Only one of these options can be specified for each schedule.

## Amortisation Method

For each of the surplus/deficit schedules set up, the user can choose
one of three methods to amortise. The options are:

-   a Percentage of Salaries
-   a Level Amount
-   a Fixed Amount plus Accrued Interest on the remaining
    surplus/deficit.

Check the box to select which to use.

## Term

Enter the term (in years) over which the contributions to amortise the
surplus/deficit are to be made.

## Amortisation Interest Rate (% p.a.)

This is the annual rate at which the amortisation contributions will be
discounted. This will typically be the same as the discount rate.

contains the rate applicable. Once selected the current value of the
Global Financial Parameter is shown to the right of this field.
