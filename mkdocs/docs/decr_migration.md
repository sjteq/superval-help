# Decr Migration



## Select Rate Tables File

The Superval/21 Rate Tables file (DECR.sf in the Superval/21 System
directory) to be migrated can be located in the system folder of
Superval/21.

To be distinguished from the Superval/21 Rate Tables file the SuperVal
Rate Tables file will be named `SVDECR.sf`. Note that once converted the
new file cannot be used in the Superval/21 system again as the index of
the file has been converted to a new format (the original file will, of
course, still exist).

## OK

When you have finished entering the relevant information, click the _OK_
button to move to the next screen.

SuperVal will check that all of the required entries on the page have
been made. If additional fields require data SuperVal will show briefly
in red which is the first of these fields found on the page.

## Cancel

Clicking on the _Cancel_ button allows you to return to the previous
screen without saving any of your changes.
