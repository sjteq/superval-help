## Retrieve Original Run Parameters

If this box is checked before selecting a set of Saved Results, the
Parameter settings (that is, the age range and grouping and the
comparison table) used in the original investigation run will be
retrieved.

If it is unchecked, the current Parameter settings will be maintained.

## Start Age

The Start Age is the minimum age at which investigation results will be
output to the file (or in the review of the investigation, the graphical
display).

Note that the results for all ages are calculated (and saved). The Start
Age can be adjusted when reviewing the investigation results.

## End Age

The End Age is the maximum age at which investigation results will be
output to the file (or in the review of the investigation, the graphical
display).

It is rounded to the next highest multiple of the Grouping of Data
factor from the Start Age.

Note that the results for all ages are calculated (and saved). The End
Age can be adjusted when reviewing the investigation results.

## Grouping of Results - Every

The Grouping of Data factor determines the size of the age sub-divisions
used to summarise investigation results output to the file (or in the
review of the investigation, the graphical display).

Note that the results for all ages are calculated (and saved). The
Grouping of Data factor can be adjusted when reviewing the investigation
results.

## Expected Table

The Rate Table Code of the `expected` table for comparison with the
actual Scheme experience.

The starting point for the comparison table is generally the `expected`
table that was assumed at the previous investigation.

## Decr Help

Rate tables can be selected by any of the following methods:

-   Right-click on the field for a list of appropriate Rate Tables. For
    a field that will accept more than one type of Rate Table (e.g.
    Miscellaneous Tables), the list will be restricted to the current
    Table Type specified in the field â€“ if you wish to see all allowable
    Rate Tables, delete the Table Type from the field before clicking;
    or
-   Double Clicking on the field will produce the Rate Tables form where
    Rate Tables can be viewed (numerically and graphically) and Rate
    Tables can be added or edited. A Rate Table can be selected by
    pressing the Select button or double clicking on the Rate Table
    description in the tree; or
-   the list of allowable Rate Tables can be scrolled through by
    pressing the `<` or `>` keys. The description of the Rate Table to
    the right of the field will change as each new Table is selected.

## Age Rating

Any Rate Table can be rated up or down by a number of years as required
to make the rate at every age `lighter` or `heavier` than in the
original table.

A value of `+10` will result, for example, in the value selected for a
30 year old actually being the rate for a 40 year old and for a value of
`-5` would mean that the value at age 25 is selected.

If an age rating of a fraction of a year is required, a new table will
have to be created through the Edit rate table option on the Rate Table
form.

## Percentage Rating

A percentage adjustment can be made to either a Rate Table or a Salary.

The Rate Tables can be adjusted by a percentage loading to make the
decrement rate lighter or heavier than the original table. The salary
for new entrants can be loaded to reflect changes in the salary profile.

Enter the number as percentage above 100% i.e. if a loading of 110% is
required then enter `10` or if a loading of 90% then enter `-10`. If no
adjustment is required then leave blank.
