## Validation Report

The Validation Report contains a summary of any issues found in the
data.

It will contain information on the number of records, number of
categories, number of errors and number of warnings.

The user should confirm that these values are as expected before
proceeding.

## Edit Source File

Click _Edit Source File_ button to open the CSV file containing the data
in Excel. Changes can then be made to the data if required.

Please note that if changes are made to the CSV file then these
amendments will not be shown in the original Excel file containing the
data. An alternative approach would be to edit the Excel file containing
the data and to re-load.
