# Factor Migration



## Select Factor Sets

Select from the list the Sets of Factors in the Superval/21 Factor Table
Files (\*.SFT in the Superval/21 System directory) to be migrated. This
will be located in the system folder of Superval/21.

SuperVal will have only one Factors File storing all sets of date
related factors. Once migrated it will be named SVFactors.sf.

Note that once converted the new file cannot be used in the Superval/21
system again as the index of the file has been converted to a new format
(the original file will, of course, still exist).

## OK

When you have finished entering the relevant information, click the _OK_
button to move to the next screen.

SuperVal will check that all of the required entries on the page have
been made. If additional fields require data SuperVal will show briefly
in red which is the first of these fields found on the page.

## Cancel

Clicking on the _Cancel_ button allows you to return to the previous
screen without saving any of your changes.
