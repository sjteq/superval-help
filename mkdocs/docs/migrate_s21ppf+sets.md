# Migrate S21PPF: Sets



## PPFSets

The Sets of PPF Parameters in the Superval/21 PPF Library Files (\*.PFF
in the Superval/21 System directory) to be migrated can be located in
either the Library Folder of SuperVal or the system folder of
Superval/21.

SuperVal will have only one PPF Parameters File storing all sets of PPF
Parameters. To be distinguished from the Superval/21 PPF Library files
it will be named SVPPFFile.sf.

Note that once converted the new file cannot be used in the Superval/21
system again as the index of the file has been converted to a new format
(the original file will, of course, still exist).
