## Logging Level

Within SuperVal the ability of each user to perform particular tasks is
determined by their own Access Level and the Access Level the System
Administrator has decided is required for each task. The System
Administrator will specify here the Access Level required for modifying
general parameter sets i.e. the ability to either delete or migrate them
from earlier versions.

Only users with an Access Level equal to or greater than the levels
specified will be able to delete parameter sets or migrate from earlier
versions respectively.

The [Access Level](users+accesslevel.md) for each individual user is
set in the _Tools&gt;Administration&gt;Manage Users_ menu.

## Log File History

The log history for the load sharing will be stored for the number of days entered in this field.

## Add HTTP Broker

Add a new SuperVal HTTP Request Broker.
 
If the User has Administrator rights, other users will be able
to use the broker created (once the Administrator has activated it).
 
If the User does not have Administrator rights, only that User can
activate the Broker created by themselves.

## Edit HTTP Broker

Edit the selected HTTP Request Broker. 

The highlighted Broker from the Broker list can be edited.

## Delete HTTP Broker

Delete the selected HTTP Request Broker. 

The highlighted Broker from the Broker list will be deleted.

## Save

Clicking on the _Save_ button allows you to save the entries.

## Quit

your changes.

In some of the screens you will be asked to confirm if you want to exit
_Ignoring all changes_. If you click _Yes_, the file will be closed
without saving any changes. If you click _No_ you will be returned to your
original screen.

From the Browser, the _Quit_ button will take you to a graphical display
of the results.
