## Cash Flow File

The following functionality can be used to calculate the internal rate
of return for a series of cashflows.

Enter the filename of the .txt file containing the cash flow information
in the Scheme Folder. The cash flows do not need to be in chronological
order.

This file must be in the format of a series of dates each followed by a
cash flow (there is no limit to the number of cash flows that can be
specified).

The opening Scheme balance should be shown as a positive cashflow and
the closing Scheme balance shown as a negative cash flow.

Double Clicking will produce a `standard` Dialog of the available data
files in the Scheme Folder.

## Format of Dates in File

Specify the format of the dates in the cash flow data file. This should
contain a 4 digit value for the years.

## Estimated Return

Specify an initial guess of the Internal Rate of Return as the starting
point for the calculation.

A good guess will enable quicker convergence and would determine the
result in the (unlikely) event of multiple solutions.

## Run

Click the _Run_ button to run the calculations.

## SaveAs

Click the _Save As_ button to save with a new file name.

## Save

Clicking on the _Save_ button allows you to save the entries.

## Quit

Clicking on the _Quit_ button allows you to exit without saving any of
your changes.

In some of the screens you will be asked to confirm if you want to exit
_Ignoring all changes_. If you click _Yes_, the file will be closed
without saving any changes. If you click _No_ you will be returned to your
original screen.

From the Browser, the _Quit_ button will take you to a graphical display
of the results.
