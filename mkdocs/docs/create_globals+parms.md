# Create Globals: Parms



## Global Parameter Types

Select which parameter type is required to create a set of Globals.
Users can select Decrement Rates, Spouse Parameters, Spreading Dates,
Retirement Age, Retirement Factors, Cash Parameters and Commutation
Factors.

## Membership Groups (ie Actives, Deferreds and Pensioners kept separate)

## Decrement Types (eg Retirement and Ill-Health Global Parameters kept separate)

## Field Types (eg Cash and Cash on Top Global Parameters kept separate)

## Sex (ie Male and Female Global Parameters kept separate)

There are four checkboxes here

Global names for Actives, Deferreds and Pensioners can be kept separate
if this option is checked. If unchecked the Global names will be merged
and used across modules when possible.

If the Decrement Types is checked, then different types of decrement
such as Retirement or Ill Health would have global names created with
the type of decrement in the name.

If Field types is checked then the global names will be differentiated
by parameter type

If Sex is checked, the global names will contain the sex in the global
names.

## Actives

## Deferreds

## Pensioners

If any parameter sets match existing Globals then checking this box
means the system will use the existing global names. If unchecked the
system will create some new default names for users.
