## Grid Help

Right-clicking on a Row Number presents a menu with the following
options, which allow you to expand or reduce the number of rows of data
to be entered:

-   Add a New Row to the bottom of the grid;
-   Insert a New Row at the position of the cursor; and
-   Delete the Current Row at the position of the cursor.

## Grid Help

Right-clicking on the Top Left Corner of the grid displays a menu which
allows you to set the following Grid Editing Options:

-   Editing of a cell can be invoked by either clicking on the cell or
    by pressing F2 when the cell is active (Clicking will only change
    the current active cell); and
-   determine the cursor movement once editing is complete to be either
    to the next cell down, the next cell to the right or to stay in the
    current cell.
