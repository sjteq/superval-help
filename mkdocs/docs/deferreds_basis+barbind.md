Select from the drop-down list which set of Early Retirement Reduction
Factors to use. The options are

-   ERF1

-   Use Barber Start and End Dates.

ERF1 and ERF2 are specified on the Ret Pension Tab.

If `Use Barber Start and End Dates` is selected, the user will be
required to enter these dates on the Legislation Tab. For males,
SuperVal will apply ERF2 between Barber Start Date and Barber End Date
and ERF1 for all other periods of service. For females, SuperVal will
apply ERF2 for service prior to the Barber End Date and ERF1 for service
after this date. In addition, the user will be required to specify the
[Start Date](deferreds_basis+indstart.md) and [Finish
Date](deferreds_basis+indfinish.md) for the PUP.
