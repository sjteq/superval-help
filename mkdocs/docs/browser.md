# Browser



## Text

The file is displayed one page at a time. If the file does not contain
page breaks, the file will be broken up according to the page length in
the User Preferences.

When the cursor is in this display, the following keys can be used to
move through the file:

-   PgUp/PgDn to move vertically (within page);
-   Ctrl PgUp/PgDn to move horizontally (within page); and
-   Alt PgUp/PgDn to change Page.

## Filename

Specify the Filename to be browsed. The file can be located anywhere on
your computer so the full path and filename must be specified.

To assist the selection of files, the following options are available:

-   Right Click for the list of recent files opened in the Browser; or
-   Double Click for the standard Windows Open File Dialog.

## Page Number

The Page Number is displayed here and can be changed here for quicker
movement through the file.

Movement through the file can also be achieved using the floating
button bar as well as Ctrl-Home or Ctrl-End keystrokes.

## Web Browser

Pressing the _Web Browser_ button will show the currently displayed
results in your Web Browser.

## Set Font

Pressing the _Set Font_ button allows you to change the font used to
display the file on the screen.

## Edit

Pressing the _Edit_ button allows you to edit the currently displayed file
using the ASCII editor specified in the User Preferences.

## Delete

Pressing the _Delete_ button will, after confirmation, allow you to delete
the currently displayed file.

## Print

Pressing the _Print_ button enables printing of:

-   all of the currently displayed file;
-   the currently displayed page;
-   a selection of multiple pages; or
-   the currently selected text on the currently displayed page.

Printer settings (the printer, orientation, left and top margins and
font) can also be set.

The entire file or the current page can also be printed using the
`floating` button bar (on the printer selected on the button bar also) â€“
all other settings (orientation, left and top margins and font) will be
the last saved printer settings.

## Quit

Clicking on the _Quit_ button allows you to exit without saving any of
your changes.

In some of the screens you will be asked to confirm if you want to exit
_Ignoring all changes_. If you click _Yes_, the file will be closed
without saving any changes. If you click _No_ you will be returned to your
original screen.

From the Browser, the _Quit_ button will take you to a graphical display
of the results.
