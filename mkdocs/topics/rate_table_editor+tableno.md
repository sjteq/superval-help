# Table Number

The Table Number field contains a list of available Rate Table Codes.

In Add mode, the list will contain all unused Rate Table codes (of the
particular type being added) for selection of the new Rate Table code.

In Edit mode, the list will contain the Rate Table code being edited
plus all unused Rate Table codes (of the particular type being added)
for selection of the Rate Table code. By selecting a new Rate Table
code, a new Rate Table can be created based on the values of an existing
Rate Table (or the existing Rate Table can be renamed).
