# General Parameter Access Levels

Within SuperVal the ability of each user to perform particular tasks is
determined by their own Access Level and the Access Level the System
Administrator has decided is required for each task. The System
Administrator will specify here the Access Level required for modifying
general parameter sets i.e. the ability to either delete or migrate them
from earlier versions.

Only users with an Access Level equal to or greater than the levels
specified will be able to delete parameter sets or migrate from earlier
versions respectively.

The [Access Level](users+accesslevel.md) for each individual user is
set in the _Tools&gt;Administration&gt;Manage Users_ menu.
