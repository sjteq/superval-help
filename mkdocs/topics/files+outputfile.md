# Output Data File

Specify a name for the data file. The filename specified must not
already exist as it will not overwrite an existing file. It will be
created in the Scheme Folder.

Double Clicking will activate the standard Windows Open File Dialog
box for selection of a file (which can be used as a `starting point` for
the name of the file).
