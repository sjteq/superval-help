# Barber Adjustment to Benefits on Withdrawal

If you have a withdrawal decrement, the accumulated benefit from the
Slices will be valued at the [Normal Retirement Age](bases+nra.md)
specified on the Membership Tab. The early retirement/late retirement
parameters are ignored.

If part of the accumulated benefit can be taken earlier or later than
NRA, then a loading to that part of the withdrawal liability can be
made. The loading adjustment is applied to the accumulated benefits
arising from all Slices where Early Retirement Reduction Factors 1
(ERF1) has been selected.

The loading can either be fixed or variable. If the loading is fixed
then enter the loading to be applied to the benefit as a multiplier ie
to load the benefits by 20% enter a loading of 1.2. If the loading
varies with the Financial Assumptions used then enter the loading as a
Scheme Constant. (Right click over the field for a list of the constants
that have been defined.)

Different loadings can be applied to the Male and Female benefits and
the benefits arising from each of the 4 different pension increase
rates.

Although SuperVal will not apply early retirement reduction factors to
the different Benefit Slices on withdrawal, it is able to determine
which part of the accumulated benefits arises from Slices with ERF1 and
which part arises from Slices with ERF2. The accumulated benefits
arising from Slices with ERF1 will be multiplied by the loading factor
in these fields.
