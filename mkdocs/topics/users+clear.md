# The Clear Password button

The _Clear Password_ button will remove the current password set by the
user and allocate a new password (the user’s Nickname followed by
today’s date in DDMM form), or, if not mandatory, a blank password.

This may be used in the event that a user forgets his password. The user
can change the password on the User Preferences form.
