# Quick_Scenario+Solve

  
If amortisation is included when consolidating, then selecting _Amortise
Deficit_ will adjust the amortisation assumptions to amortise any
surplus / deficit.  
  
A new box will appear asking which amortisations are to be included:  
  
-   Both Amortisations  
-   Amortisation 1  
-   Amortisation 2  
  
and which of the two currently variable fields out of rate / term /
amount (one has previously been chosen to be constant) is to change to
amortise the surplus / deficit.  

If _Both Amortisations_ is chosen then a further box _Shared_ will be
displayed with a choice between sharing between the two amortisation
methods equally or proportionally.
