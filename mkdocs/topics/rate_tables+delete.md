# The Delete button

When a Rate Table or Factor Table is highlighted (and you have been
given the appropriate access level), a Delete Button will become
enabled.

On pressing the _Delete_ button, the Rate Table/Factor Table will, after
confirmation, be deleted.

Note that after the _Delete_ button is pressed and until the deletion is
completed or aborted, the Rate Table file is locked to stop other users
from making simultaneous changes to this Rate Table file (which may
cause corruption of the file). Thus it is recommended that the shortest
time possible be spent in this mode.
