# CONFIG_LOADSHARE+ADDBROKER

Add a new SuperVal HTTP Request Broker.
 
If the User has Administrator rights, other users will be able
to use the broker created (once the Administrator has activated it).
 
If the User does not have Administrator rights, only that User can
activate the Broker created by themselves.
