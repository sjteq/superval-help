# Spouse’s Ill-health Pension/Death Pension Extra Prospective Service

This field is used to increase the amount of prospective service used in
the calculation of either the ill health pension or the death in service
pension. (Separate fields are available for each of these benefits.) It
might be used where normal retirement age has been reduced post-Barber,
but the spouse’s ill health pension or death in service pension is still
based on prospective service to the member’s original normal retirement
age. Enter the number of years (and part years) additional service that
should be included. For 5 years and 6 months enter `5.5`.
