# Parameter File

The name of the Parameter file into which the parameters will be saved.
This file is automatically given an extension of `.SF`.

Note that parameter sets that are stored at the Scheme level (that is,
all parameters other than category level `basis` details) can only be
saved in the Scheme Level Parameter file selected when logging on for
this session (and thus this field is disabled).

However, with parameter sets that are stored at the Category Level (such
as category-level basis details), any number of parameter sets can be
stored in a parameter file and there can be any number of parameter
files.

The preferred configuration is to have only one parameter file with
category level parameters but there may be situations where more than
one may be preferred.

For example, one parameter file might contain category level bases with
the previous valuation basis and bases with the new valuation basis in a
second file or bases for each actives category could be in one file and
another file could contain bases for each pensioners category (although
in both these examples all bases could be saved to the same parameter
file, if preferred).
