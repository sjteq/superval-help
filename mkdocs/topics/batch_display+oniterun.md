# Unattended Run button

The_Unattended Run_ button allows you to run the valuation without any
error reporting. This means that where there might be errors for example
in the validation of the basis details (but not in the coding of
benefits) the run will proceed. A valuation error log file will be
produced if any errors occur.

Alternatively, use the _Run_ button which will require the user to confirm
at various points they are happy with the steps so far.
