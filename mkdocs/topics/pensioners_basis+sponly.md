# Spouse’s Reversion Only

Check this box if you wish to value the spouse’s reversion only.

This can be used when either the entire member’s pension has been
commuted and only the liability for the contingent spouse’s reversion
remains or where separate data items are available for the single life
and the reversionary pension.
