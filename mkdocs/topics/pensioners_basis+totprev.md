This field is only required if [Use Approximate GMP
Ratio](pensioners_basis+gmpsplit.md) is checked.

Select from the drop-down list the data item containing the total
Pre-1988 GMP underlying the pension at Valuation Date for members who
have not yet reached SPA. This will enable the correct adjustment
(subject to Franking Code) to be made at SPA.

This GMP can be different from the standard GMP data items (GMP0 and
GMPE0).

For example, a member who retires from deferred status before SPA where
the GMP revaluations from date of leaving are not payable until SPA.
