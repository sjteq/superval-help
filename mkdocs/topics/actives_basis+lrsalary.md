# Salary for Late Retirement

Select from the drop-down list the salary to use for Late Retirement.
The options are:

-   NRA Salary
-   Retirement Salary

If `NRA Salary` is used, specify the increases that should be applied to
salaries after NRA and before actual retirement date in the [Post NRA
Salary Revaluation Rate](actives_basis+lrsalinc.md) on the Salaries
tab.

If `Retirement Salary` is used both the [Salary Increase
Rate](actives_basis+salinc.md) (on the Financial tab) and the
[Promotional Scale Table](actives_basis+sxx.md) (on the Salaries Tab)
will be used to increase the member’s salary up to the member’s actual
