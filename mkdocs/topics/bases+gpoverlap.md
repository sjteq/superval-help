# Overlap during Guarantee Period

If the member’s pension is guaranteed, then the option to select how the
guarantee is paid becomes available.

Check this box if, on the member’s death during the guarantee period,
all outstanding payments in the guarantee period are paid as a lump sum
at death and any spouse’s reversion becomes payable immediately. When
valuing Actives or Deferreds or using the annuity calculators, the
option to select whether this benefit is discounted or undiscounted
becomes available. For Pensioners, the lump sum is calculated as the sum
of the undiscounted payments at the point of death when this option is
selected.

Leave this box unchecked if, on the member’s death during the guarantee
period, payments continue until the end of the guarantee period and any
spouse’s reversion becomes payable thereafter. Payments are always
discounted in this scenario.
