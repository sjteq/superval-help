# Upper Limit of Durations Analysed

Specify the Upper Limits of the Durations to be investigated (subject to
the limit that only 20 years of durational experience is stored).

To enable you to build durational specific rates of withdrawal, the
exposure and actual exits for all decrement investigation runs are
calculated by both age and duration (up to 20 years, beyond that is
grouped into an &ldquo;ultimate&rdquo; group).

You can specify a series of upper limits of Durations to be Analysed in
which decrements will be investigated. The lower limit will be one
greater than the previous upper limit specified. If, say, the first
upper limit specified is `5`, rates will be calculated in respect of
exits and exposure contributed in the first five years of Scheme
membership.

If ultimate rates only are required, specify an upper limit greater than
20, eg the default of `99` suggested.

A separate page of output will be produced for the durations between
each pair of durations specified.

Note that the exposure and number of exits is saved for all durations up
to 20 years so the upper limits on the Durational Ranges can be
subsequently changed when producing the graphical displays.
