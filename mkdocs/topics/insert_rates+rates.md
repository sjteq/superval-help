# Rates

You can insert (or replace) a values or insert a forgotten value(s). The
rates should be specified as a vector of rates with a space between
then.

To replace the rates already inserted, check the Replace Existing Rates
box. To insert rates, ensure that the Replace Existing Rates check box
is left blank. When an insertion is carried out, the values (equal to
number of values inserted) are moved and the table is extended.

Click the OK button to see the effect of the insertion or replacement on
the table. The user will be required to confirm they are happy with the
changes before the rate table is updated.
