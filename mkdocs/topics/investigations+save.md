# Save the Results for Sub Groups

The results (for all files or sub-groups combined) of every
investigation are always saved (to a saved results file). These results
are stored using the description applied to the parameter set when
saved.

This option allows you to also save the results for each of the files or
sub-groups specified as well. These results are stored using the
description of the saved parameter set with a suffix of the sub-group
data filename.

Stored results for each of the sub-groups means that:

-   males and females can be investigated simultaneously but separate
    results can be reviewed; and/or
-   the appropriateness of the Rate Table found to be the best fit for
    the whole group can be checked against each of the sub-groups.

It is possible to delete stored investigation results when reviewing the
investigation. It is recommended that any results for inappropriate
groupings such as heterogeneous groups (eg males and females combined
when the decrement should clearly be different) or any small groups (for
which comparisons are not reliable) or for any runs containing erroneous
data should be deleted to avoid possible error.
