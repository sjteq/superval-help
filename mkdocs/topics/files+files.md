# Data File(s)

Double click to select the filename (or filenames, if appropriate) of
the member data files to be processed.

Data files may contain inactive members (exits and members who have
joined after the valuation date) as well as active members.

The file(s) must be in the format specified in the data format.

If specification of only one file is allowed, a list of the allowable
files specified on the Scheme Details will be presented with a Right
Click. Note that any filenames used on that list will be `relative
value`, that is, the filename specified is controlled by the label to
the right of the field. If the filename is changed on the Scheme Details
then the filename in the saved parameters will also be change.
