# File Display

The file is displayed one page at a time. If the file does not contain
page breaks, the file will be broken up according to the page length in
the User Preferences.

When the cursor is in this display, the following keys can be used to
move through the file:

-   PgUp/PgDn to move vertically (within page);
-   Ctrl PgUp/PgDn to move horizontally (within page); and
-   Alt PgUp/PgDn to change Page.
