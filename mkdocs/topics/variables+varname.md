# Variable Name

Scheme Constants can be used to define loading factors that change with
the financial basis for the scheme.

Enter a name for the Global Financial Parameter or the Constant being
defined.

This name will be used to select the Global Financial Parameter in the
individual basis files. The name should be generic i.e. InterestRate1 so
that it remains relevant if the value changes at a future valuation
date. The purpose of these variables is to enable a simple method of
making changes to assumptions without the need to modify all category
sets.

The Variable Name must not be the same as a Variable Name already used
in SuperVal system. Using an existing Variable Name may cause a system
crash or result in incorrect results for the calculations.

To add or delete a Global Financial Parameter right click over the
numbers to the side of this table. To change a Global Variable Name
click once over the existing name until the name is highlighted.
