## Fixed Interest 15 years Gilt Yield

Enter the FTSE Fixed Interest 15 year Gilt Yield as at the Applicable
Date. (SuperVal will calculate the annualised yield.)

This yield will be used in the calculation of Yield C (post 30 October
2009 valuations).  The annualised yield will be calculated as follows:

$$\left( 1 + \frac{Fixed Interest_{15yr Yield}}{2} \right)^{2} - 1$$

The adjustment required to Yield C (post 30 October 2009 valuations) is
documented in the Guidance from the PPF and is determined by the date of
valuation.  SuperVal automatically allows for the adjustments documented
in Guidance Note A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8 and A9.     

The yield is entered as a percentage, i.e. for 3% enter `3` and not `0.03`.
