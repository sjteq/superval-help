# Conts Data Item/Plus Conts Data Item

These fields can be used to value an additional contribution item to be
paid on death in deferment. Select from the drop-down list the
appropriate data item. Once specified, you will be asked to enter the
[Conts Interest Rate](deferreds_basis+idconts1.md) to be used.

If you only wish to value one cash lump sum to be paid on death, leave
the second item blank.

Please note that the standard item `ACW` is actually used to value any
underpin rather than a return of contributions. However, it can still be
used as a contributions item by selecting it here.
