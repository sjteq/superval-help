# Decrements Investigated

Up to 9 different decrements can be investigated simultaneously
(although not all need be mutually exclusive, for example, one could
investigate withdrawal due to all causes including retirement and
retrenchment and voluntary withdrawal only in different decrements).

Results will be separately produced for each of the different decrements
investigated (eg Retirement, Death and Withdrawal).

For each decrement to be investigated, it necessary to check a box
(relating to the other 9 tabs on the form) and specify the name of the
decrement i.e. Withdrawal, Death. This name will then be used as the name
of the tab for identification. The user will then be required to enter
the settings for the Individual Decrements on the relevant tab.
