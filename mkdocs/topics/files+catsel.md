# Use Category Selection

Click to highlight the category data you wish to use in this Basis
Category. In V9.00+ the category data can contain up to a maximum of 10
characters.

This will be useful if setting up benefit changes in addition to the
current scheme categories. For example, the user may want to run the
Category 1 data through two similar benefit categories, one with NRA 65
and one with NRA 67. The user should create a second category but select
the data for Category 1 here. The user can then make the required
changes to the rest of the benefit category.

An alternative to using the same Category Data in multiple categories
would be to create a new Basis File for the changed benefits. Most users
will find it easier to identify the purpose of the runs as the filename
can reflect the basis setup i.e. Benefit Improvements or Sale and
Purchase.
