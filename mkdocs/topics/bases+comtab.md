# Pension Commutation Factor Table

Double click to select the rate table containing the Commutation Factors
ie the amount of cash received for each pound per annum of pension
commuted. Please note that SuperVal assumes exits prior to NRA occur
half-way through the year i.e. 0.5 years, 1.5 years etc after the
valuation date. Exits at NRA occur at the beginning of the year. This
should be reflected in the Commutation Factors entered into the table ie
for ages prior to NRA the factor in the table should be the factor that
would apply at the point of exit.

For example, a factor of 9 at age 65 means that for every pound
surrendered in pension at age 65 the member would receive Â£9 in cash.

Separate tables can be specified for males and females and for each of
the different pension increase rates (Main, Special, Pension Increase 3
and Pension Increase 4) being used.

Even if cash is payable on top of pension benefits, cash commutation
factors are still required for application of IR Maximum rules.
