If the option to [Reduce Pensions at SPA](pensioners_basis+puprdn.md)
has been checked enter the data item containing the pension at `Date
Pension Commenced` that corresponds to the current Pension Data Item

This is used to determine the pension increases given on the pension
since retirement for (full) franking of GMP revaluations at SPA or
death.
