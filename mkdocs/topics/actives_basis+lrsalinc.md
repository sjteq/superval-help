# Post NRA Salary Revaluation Rate

The user has the option to override the salary increase assumption for
members who retire after NRD. This field is only used if _NRA Salary_ is
selected in the [Salary for Late Retirement](actives_basis+lrsalary.md)
on the Late Retirement tab and only applies to the salary definition
selected.

Select from the drop-down list the Global Financial Parameter that
contains the rate applicable. Once selected, the current value of the
Global Financial Parameter is shown to the right of this field.

To add a new Global Financial Parameter use the _Edit Scheme Financials_
button at the bottom of this tab.

If left blank the [Overall Salary Increase
Rate](actives_basis+salinc.md) on the Financial tab will be used.

Note: Not all functionality is available to all users.
