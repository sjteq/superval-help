# LRF1: Cash on Top

This field allows the user to specify a set of late retirement
adjustment factors that apply to cash on top options other than `Accrual
&times; Salary for each year`. When using `Accrual × Salary for each year`
SuperVal always assumes the Late Retirement Factors are equal to 1.00.
The user can specify 4 different sets of Late Retirement Factors. These
are:

-   LRF1 for use with Revaluation Rates in deferment 1 and 3
-   LRF1 for use with Revaluation Rate 2
-   LRF2 for use with Revaluation Rates in deferment 1 and 3
-   LRF2 for use with Revaluation Rate 2

Double click to select from a list of available rate tables.

SuperVal assumes exits at NRA and all subsequent ages occur at age exact
(and not half way through the year). Double-click to select from a list
of available rate tables.

Please note that if this field is left blank for cash-on-top benefits
then, for options other than `Accrual × Salary for each year` the LRF
pensions factors will be used. If you do not wish the cash-on-top
benefits to be adjusted, specify a table with all LRFs set to 1.00.
