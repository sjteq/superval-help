# Cap Increase Rate

Inland Revenue Limits for joiners Post-31/05/1989 are calculated using
the Earnings Cap. This is the rate at which the Earnings Cap will
increase to date of exit.

Select from the drop-down list the Global Financial Parameter that
contains the rate applicable. Once selected, the current value of the
Global Financial Parameter is shown to the right of this field.

To add a new Global Financial Parameter use the _Edit Scheme Financials_
button at the bottom of this Tab.

The Earnings Cap, to which this rate is applied, is taken from the
Factor File. The Factor that contains the Earnings Cap is called Max.
Please note that the calculations determine the total benefit amount for
Post-1989 joiners using the Earnings Cap figure but do not restrict the
actual salary used in the calculations to the Earnings Cap. In order to
limit the salary used to the Earnings Cap set a Salary Maximum on the
Salaries Tab.
