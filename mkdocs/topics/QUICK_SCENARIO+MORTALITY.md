# Quick_Scenario+mortality

  
If, under File &gt; Properties &gt; Valn Options the box _Output Separate
Cashflows for Spouse_ is ticked, then it is possible to adjust the
post-retirement mortality.  
  
If the _per Annum_ box is unchecked then mortality will be adjusted
overall by the percentage specified. A number or a vector can be input here.
