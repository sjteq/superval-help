# Deduct Tier 1/Deduct Tier 2

You can deduct the benefits calculated on Tier 1 from either of the
benefit calculated on Tier 2 or Tier 3. In Tier 3 you can also deduct
the sum of benefits calculated in Tiers 1 and 2. Check these boxes to
determine which of the Tiers are deducted.

Typical use of this field is for a greater-of benefit comparison. For
example, suppose a scheme provides a benefit which is the greater of
$\frac{Service \times Salary}{80}$ and $\frac{Service \times (Salary - LEL)}{60}$.

Two salaries have been defined in the Salary Tab i.e. `Salary1` is Salary
with no deduction and `Salary2` is Salary with a LEL deduction.

The benefits on Tier 1 will be set up to define the 1/80ths benefit. The
benefits on Tier 2 will be set up to define the excess of the 1/60th
benefit over the 1/80th benefit where this is greater than 0. Specify
the 1/60th benefit on Tier 2 then check the box to deduct Tier 1. Also
ensure that the Minimum Pension specified is zero. (This will ensure the
excess is only valued where greater than zero.) The total benefit valued
by the Tiers will be:

1/80ths + Max (1/60ths â€“ 1/80ths, 0) multiplied by the respective
salaries and service.
