# IR Maximum Parameters: Rules

Select from the drop-down list which of the pre-A-Day Inland Revenue
Limits to apply. The limits will be applied to the retirement pensions
calculated by SuperVal in the Benefit Slices for the corresponding
periods of service. The options are:

-   Ignore
-   Pre-1987 Rules
-   Pre-1987 or Post-1989, depending on DJF
-   Post-1987 or Post-1989, depending on DJF
-   Post-1989 Rules
-   Pre-1987, Post-1987 or Post-1989, depending on DJF

The IR maximum pension will be calculated according to the option
chosen. The Date Joined Company (DJS) is used in the calculation of the
maximum.

The Post-A-Day Tax Simplification Rules are not calculated by
SuperVal. However, there is an option to use either a percentage or
multiple data item for the cash benefit percentage which could be
manipulated to approximate this benefit.
