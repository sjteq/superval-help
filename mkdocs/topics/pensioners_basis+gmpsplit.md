# Use Approximate GMP Ratio

When the [Reduce Pensions at SPA](pensioners_basis+puprdn.md) on the
Legislation Tab is checked and the underlying GMP for each of the
pensions on the Pensions Tab is not available, SuperVal can use an
approximate allocation of the total GMPs to those pensions where
[Include in Adjustment at SPA/Death](pensioners_basis+gmpadj.md) on the
Pension Tab is selected.

To use this functionality, check this box. The user will then be
required to enter Pseudo GMPs at both retirement and the valuation date
below.
