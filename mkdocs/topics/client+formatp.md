# Format of Main Pensioners File

The Data Format of Main Pensioners Data File.

A data format is saved parameters specifying the column specification of
each of the data items contained in the data file.

Data format descriptions are prefixed by an indication of the type of
format e.g. &lt;Pen&gt; for Pensioners.

If you currently have no pensioners data formats for this Scheme, you
may leave this field blank and select the data format subsequently once
you have created the data format.
