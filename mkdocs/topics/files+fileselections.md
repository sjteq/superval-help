# Automatic Sex/Category Sub-File Creation

The sub-groups of membership data to be processed can be specified in
one of two ways:

If the Automatic Sex/Category Sub-File Creation box is unchecked, the
user will be asked to specify a list of data files (which have been
previously created) containing the data for each of the sub-groups
separately.

If the Automatic Sex/Category Sub-File Creation box is checked, the user
will specify a single file (containing the data for all groups) and then
select the sex and category combinations that you wish to be processed
(sex/category sub-files will be automatically created).
