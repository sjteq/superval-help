# Pre Valuation Date Revaluation

Select from the drop-down list how to revalue the excess pension between
date of leaving and valuation date. The options are:

-   No
-   Fixed Rate
-   s52 index

Use `No` where the excess pension already includes revaluations to the
valuation date.

Use `Fixed Rate` where a single rate of revaluation applies between date
of leaving and date of valuation. The value can then be entered in the
[Pre Valn Date Rate.](deferreds_basis+pastrevn.md)

Uses `s52 Index` where a table of revaluation rates between date of
leaving and date of valuation should be applied. The table can be
entered in the [Pre Valn Date Factor Set](deferreds_basis+revset.md).
