# PPF_Yields+PPF20


## Fixed Interest 20 years Gilt Yield

Enter the FTSE Fixed Interest 20 year Gilt Yield as at the Applicable
Date. (SuperVal will calculate the annualised yield.)

This yield will be used in the calculation of Yield B (post 30 March
2008 valuations).  Yield B (post 30 March 2008 valuations) is calculated
as follows:

$$\left( 1 + \frac{Fixed Interest_{20yr Yield}}{2} \right)^2 -1 $$
<!-- 
(1 + 0.5 x Fixed Interest 20yr Yield) ^ 2 - 1
 -->

The adjustment required to Yield B (post 30 March 2008) is documented in
the Guidance from the PPF and is determined by the date of valuation. 
SuperVal automatically allows for the adjustments documented in Guidance
Note A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8 and A9.     

The yield is entered as a percentage, i.e. for 3% enter `3` and not `0.03`.
