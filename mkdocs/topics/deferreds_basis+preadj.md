# Adjustment Factor for Pre-1988 GMP/Post-1988 GMP

A negative or positive loading can be applied to the Pre-1988 GMP or the
Post-1988 GMP.

Enter the number as a multiplier i.e. `1.1` for a 10% increases or `0.9` for a
10% decrease. If no adjustment is required enter `1`. If `0` is entered the
liability for the Pre-1988 GMP or Post-1988 GMP respectively will be
