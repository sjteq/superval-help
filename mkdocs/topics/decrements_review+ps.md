# Durations Analysed

Specify the Duration range to be investigated (subject to the limit that
only 20 years of durational experience is stored).

To enable you to build durational specific rates of withdrawal, the
exposure and actual exits for all decrement investigation runs are
calculated by both age and duration (up to 20 years, beyond that is
grouped into an &ldquo;ultimate&rdquo; group).

You can specify a range of Durations to be Analysed in which decrements
will be investigated. If, say, the range is from `0` to `5`, rates will
be calculated in respect of exits and exposure contributed in the first
five years of Scheme membership.

If ultimate rates only are required, specify a range from `0` to a
number greater than 20, eg the default of `99` suggested.
