# Replace Existing Rates

Existing rates can be either replaced by new values (checked) or the new
values can be inserted into the rate table (unchecked).

When an insertion is carried out, a number of values (equal to number of
values inserted) are moved beyond the last age/duration displayed and
are lost.
