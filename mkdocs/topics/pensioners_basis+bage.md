# Benefit Commencing At Age

This is used to defer the start date of a pension until a point in the
future.

Enter the age at which the pension will commence. For example, a pension
may become payable from SPA. In this case SPA would be the Benefit
Commencing Age.

Any remaining guarantee period calculated is based solely on the data
contained in the data item Date Pension Commenced and not on the age
entered here.

To value an immediate pension either leave blank or enter `0`.
