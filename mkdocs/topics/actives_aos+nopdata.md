# Insufficient Previous Data

This field enables you to specify a non-standard numeric data field that
indicates whether sufficient data exists to be able carry out Reserve
calculations at the Previous Valuation Date or Entry (if later).

If the specified data field is zero (or blank) then no Reserve
projections will be carried out (and the approximations will apply).

For example, if contributions information is available but salary
information is not, SuperVal would derive a Reserve based upon
contributions benefits only as the salary benefits would be zero (as
SuperVal is not intelligent enough to know if a data field should not be
zero!)

The specified data field may be a field especially for this purpose.
