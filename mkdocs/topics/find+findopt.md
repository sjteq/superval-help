# Search Options

Searches can be made in Defined Fields only or additionally in other
areas of the file not displayed in the editor.

The cursor will be placed in the field containing the Search Text if it
is in a Defined Field or the entire record will be highlighted if the
Search Text is in the record but outside the defined fields.
