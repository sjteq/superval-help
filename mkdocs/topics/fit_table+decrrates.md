# Rate

Enter a selection of ages that are in the table you are trying to match.
SuperVal will require at least 4 entries to try to match a table.
However, the more points of reference you are able to provide, the
better match you are likely to find within the tables.

After selecting OK, SuperVal will provide a list of best fit tables.
SuperVal will provide details of the Table to select and the Age Rating
and Percentage Rating to apply to it. It will then show you details of
the rates that would be used by SuperVal if this table, so adjusted was
selected.
