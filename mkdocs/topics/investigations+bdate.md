# Start Date

Enter the Start Date from which the analysis or investigation is
performed.

This defaults to the Previous Valuation Date. You can overwrite this if
you wish as any analysis or investigation can be carried out for periods
other than the inter-valuation period provided there is sufficient data.

Dates can be entered in almost any format and they will be automatically
converted to DD/MM/YYYY format.
