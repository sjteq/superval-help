# Table Number

The Table Number field is a display only field showing the Rate Table
Code used to identify the Rate Table.

With effect from V9.03, SuperVal Rate Tables can be prefixed by both an
upper case and a lower case letter. (Previously all Rate Tables had an
upper case letter.) This acts to double the number of Rate Tables
available but care must be taken to ensure the intended table is
selected.
