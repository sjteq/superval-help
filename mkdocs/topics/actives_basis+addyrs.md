# Added Years

This field is used to define the number of Added Years either where
these are fixed for all members or a member specific amount. To enable
it ensure the [Start Date](actives_basis+stdate.md) for this slice is
blank. Added Years might have arisen from an Augmentation exercise or a
Transfer-In to the scheme.

If the number of Added Years granted is the same for all members, enter
the number of years granted in years (and part) years i.e. for 5 years and
6 months enter `5.5`.

If the number of years varies per member, then select from the drop-down
list the data item containing the appropriate data. The data item should
contain the number of complete (and part) years granted to each member.
