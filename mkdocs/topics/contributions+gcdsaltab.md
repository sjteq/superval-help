Enter the Salary Band Limits that apply on the anniversary of the
valuation date in the [Base Year of Salary Band
Table](contributions+gcdsalbase.md).

The entries in Band 0 correspond to the bottom of the first salary band
ie the salary level at which contributions start.

The number of entries for each band does not need to be identical.
However, the geometric mean of the last two values will be used for all
years into the future. (To use a particular value into the future ensure
this is entered into the last two durations.)

The contribution salary at the mid-point will be compared with the
geometric average of the Salary Band Limit at the beginning and end of
year.

The maximum number of Salary Band Limits is 10. (This is consistent with
9 salary bands.)
