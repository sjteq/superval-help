Other connection properties necessary will vary and will depend on the
local setup of SQL Server such as the authentication used.Â  Additional rows can be added, by
right-clicking on a Row Heading and selecting from the pop-up menu,
allowing any additional property names and their values to be specified.

For example, if using SQL Server Authentication add the following 2 rows
below the Server row:

-   User ID
-   Password 

Enter the details of your User ID and
password for the SQL Authentication details.
