If `Varying Percentage of Salary based on Attained Age` or ` Varying
Percentage of Salary based on Age at Entry` has been selected, the
double click to select the Rate Table containing the contribution rates
for each age or age at entry. A typical rate table would be of type `FX`
(but `EX`, `GX`, or `HX` could all be used).

The values in the table should be entered as percentages i.e. for 5% the
entry should be `5` and not `0.05`.
