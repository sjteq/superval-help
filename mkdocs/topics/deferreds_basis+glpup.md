# Death in Deferment: Add or Compare

SuperVal has the option to either Add or Compare the lump sum cash
benefits payable on death in deferment when a [Conts Data
Item](deferreds_basis+dconts1.md) is valued.

Select Add from the drop-down list if the lump sum on death before
retirement is the sum of the multiple of PUP and the [Conts Data
Item](deferreds_basis+dconts1.md) and [Plus Conts Data
Item](deferreds_basis+dconts1.md) increased with interest.  
Select Compare from the drop-down list if the lump sum on death before
retirement is the greater of multiple of PUP and the contribution data
items increased with interest.
