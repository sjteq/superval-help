This page will show the user a Summary of all of the Global Variables
and Global Parameter Sets that have been created by the Migration
Wizard.

For each of the Global Variables that is created, you will be able to
see the Module, the Basis File, the Category, the Frame and the
Parameter where this is used.

For each of the Global Parameter Sets you will see the Module and Basis
File.

The user should ensure that the sets created are an accurate reflection
of those needed to run the valuation.
