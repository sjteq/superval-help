# Death in Deferment Pension Benefit: Costing Method

Select from the drop-down list how to value the death in deferment
pension benefits. The options are:

-   Costing Table
-   Valuation Basis

Use `Costing Table` if you wish to apply annuities that are different to
those calculated using the valuation basis. Separate tables for males
and females will be required.

Use `Valuation Basis` to apply annuities in line with the valuation
basis.
