# Superval/21 Factor Table Sets

Select from the list the Sets of Factors in the Superval/21 Factor Table
Files (\*.SFT in the Superval/21 System directory) to be migrated. This
will be located in the system folder of Superval/21.

SuperVal will have only one Factors File storing all sets of date
related factors. Once migrated it will be named SVFactors.sf.

Note that once converted the new file cannot be used in the Superval/21
system again as the index of the file has been converted to a new format
(the original file will, of course, still exist).
