# Maximum Adjustment Factor

This field allows the user to adjust the maximum by a fixed factor. It
might be used where the data used for the maximum is out of date and
needs to be increased to take account of an extra part year of
inflation.  

Enter the number as a multiplier, e.g. `1.1` for a 10% increase or `0.9` for
a 10% decrease. For no adjustment enter a value of `1`.
