# The Add Slice button

Clicking on the _Add Slice_ button allows you to add another Slice of
benefits. Select from the box which of the slices the benefits on the
new Slice should be based on. The choices are `Default` (to base the Slice
on the defaults specified) or one of the existing Slices to copy an
existing slice of benefits. The Slice will always be added at the end of
current Slices.
