# Tier 2 Benefits Defined/Tier 3 Benefits Defined

Check the Tier 2 Benefits Defined box if you wish to define a second
Tier of benefits. Leave unchecked if there is no additional Tier of
benefits. If checked, the user will have the option to check the Tier 3
Benefits Defined Box to define a third Tier of benefits.

The benefits defined on either the second or third Tier can be added.
Alternatively, the user has the option to subtracted a previous Tier
from the final Tier of benefits defined i.e. Tier 1 or the sum of Tier 1
and Tier 2 can be deducted from Tier 3, or Tier 1 can be deducted from
Tier 2.
