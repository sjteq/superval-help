# PPF Yields: Secondary Key

The Secondary Key can be used to distinguish between different yields
that apply at the same valuation date i.e. where yields are dependent on
the date the PPF S179 (Levy) Valuation will be signed.

The user can use the Secondary Key to enter a description of the
appropriate yields i.e. `GNV2 (Pre 1 Nov 06)`. This can be either a
numeric value or a description and up to 20 characters in length.

When selecting the yields in the Scheme PPF tab, both the yield date and
the Secondary Field narrative are visible.
