# Ill Health Cash: Commutation Tables

Double click to select the rate table containing the Commutation Factors
ie the amount of cash received for each pound per annum of pension
commuted.

For example, a factor of 9 at age 65 means that for every pound
surrendered in pension at age 65 the member would receive £9 in cash.

Separate tables can be specified for males and females and for each of
the different pension increase rates (Main, Special, Pension Increase 3
and Pension Increase 4) being used.

NB: Even if cash is payable on top of pension benefits, cash commutation
factors are still required for application of IR Maximum rules.
