# Ignore Pre-1988 GMP for Death Benefits

Select how to value both the Pre-1988 GMP and the Post-1988 GMP for
Death Benefits. The options are:

-   Yes
-   No
-   Legislation.

The options are available for the Pre-1988 GMP and Post-1988 GMP
separately.

If `Yes` is selected then no death before retirement benefits will be
payable in respect of either the Pre-1988 GMP or the Post-1988 GMP.

If `No` is selected then SuperVal will value the Pre-1988 GMP or the
Post-1988 GMP multiplied by the [Spouse’s Reversion Death before
Retirement](deferreds_basis+wofrac.md) on death before retirement.

If `Legislation` is selected then the benefits payable on death before
retirement will follow legislation i.e. a 50% spouse’s pension on death
before retirement will be payable in respect of the Pre-1988 GMP for
male members only and a 50% spouse’s pension for all members in respect
of the Post-1988 GMP.
