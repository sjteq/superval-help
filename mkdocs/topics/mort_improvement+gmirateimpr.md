Check this box if the age rating being applied to the Pre Retirement,
Post Retirement and Ill Health Mortality table should also be applied to
the Mortality Improvement Factors.

For example, if a member is aged 46 nearest at valuation date and a `-2`
age rating is being applied to the Pre Retirement Mortality table. Then
if the box is unchecked, then the age that SuperVal will use at
valuation date for Mortality Improvement factors will 46. If the box is
checked, the age that SuperVal will use at valuation date for Mortality
Improvement factors will 44.
