# Apply ERFs to Spouse’s Pension

Check this box if the spouse’s death after retirement pension should be
reduced to reflect the early retirement reduction factor applied to the
member’s pension. Leave the box unchecked if the spouse’s death after
retirement pension is based on member’s pension prior to application of
any early retirement reduction factors.
