# Spouse’s Age Difference

This field is used to set an age difference between a member and their
spouse that is identical for all members. It is used when valuing death
benefits prior to retirement and contingent annuities on death after
retirement. For pensioners death benefits prior to retirement may occur
when the [Benefit Commencing Age](pensioners_basis+bage.md) is after
the member’s current age.

Enter the relevant value containing Member’s Age minus Spouse’s Age ie
if Members are 3 years older than their spouse enter `3`.

If you wish to use an Age Rating that varies with the member’s age then
leave this field blank and the Age Difference Table will become
available. (This functionality is not available for PPF runs or for the
annuity calculators.)

The Age Difference Table field is only available to some users.
