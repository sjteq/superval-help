# Past Service Surplus/Deficit Amortised

The user can specify up to two different amortisation schedules for
either the past service surplus or deficit. Within each schedule the
user can choose one of two different methods of spreading. The options
are:

-   as a percentage of the total
-   as a level amount.

If using the percentage field, enter the percentage of the
surplus/deficit to be amortised.

If using the level amount, enter the amount of surplus/deficit to be
amortised.

Only one of these options can be specified for each schedule.
