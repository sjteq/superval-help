# Scheme Fee

Scheme expenses can be expressed as a Scheme Fee which is then inflated
at a [Scheme Fee Inflation Rate](expense_rates+expf.md).

The Scheme Fee will be split between different categories of active
members in proportion to their respective total salaries. Note, that
this Fee will remain unchanged (before inflation) irrespective of the
membership level and thus, for an open fund, is generally only
appropriate if a New Entrant Replacement Model is applied.

The [Member Fee (inflating per remaining
member)](expense_rates+pmexp.md) can be used to represent a Scheme Fee
for an open fund where no replacement of members has been used. As the
amount for each member decreases each year as the member decrements but
the level of expense would (in theory) be maintained by new entrants to
the Scheme.
