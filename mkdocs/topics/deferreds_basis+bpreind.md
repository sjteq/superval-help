Select from the drop-down list which set of Early Retirement Reduction
Factors to use for the Pre-1988 GMP or the Post-1988 GMP. The options
are:

-   ERF1
-   ERF2
-   Use Barber Start and End Dates

If `Use Barber Start and End Dates` is selected, the user will be
required to enter these dates on the _Legislation_ tab. In addition, the
user will be required to enter the [Start
Date](deferreds_basis+prestart.md) for the GMP benefit and the [Finish
Date](deferreds_basis+prefinish.md) for the GMP benefit. For males,
SuperVal will apply ERF2 between Barber Start Date and Barber End Date
and ERF1 for all other periods of service. For females, SuperVal will
apply ERF2 for service prior to the Barber End Date and ERF1 for service
after this date.
