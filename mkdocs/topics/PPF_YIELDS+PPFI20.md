## PPF Yields - Post 2009 Pre-Retirement

SuperVal shows you the net yield that will be used to value compensation
increasing in deferment and accrued post 6 April 2009.  

The yield will be calculated in accordance with the Guidance issued from
the PPF documented in Guidance Notes A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8 and A9 and
then adjusted by any entry in the Post 2009 Pre Retirement Adjustment
field.
