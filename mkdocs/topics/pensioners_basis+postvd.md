# Post-1988 GMP Included at the Valuation Date

If the option to [Reduce Pension at SPA](pensioners_basis+puprdn.md)
has been checked, and you are not using the [Use Approximate GMP
Ratio](pensioners_basis+gmpsplit.md) option, then enter the data item
containing the Post-1988 GMP at retirement included in the Pension at
Valuation Date for the Pension being valued.

If the data is not available, then check the [Use Approximate GMP
Ratio](pensioners_basis+gmpsplit.md) box on the Legislation Tab.
However data items containing the total GMP included in the pensions at
Valuation Date and Retirement Date will still be required.

The member may have left active service before retiring and not yet
reached SPA. Therefore the GMP included in the pension may not yet
include any revaluation from date of leaving.
