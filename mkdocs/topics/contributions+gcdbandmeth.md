If `Differing Percentage on up to 10 Salary Bands` or `Salary Bands
Table with Differing Percentages` has been selected, then select from
the drop-down list the method for determining how the contribution rates
are applied to the Salary Bands. The options are:

-   Progressive
-   Band-Related

If `Progressive` is selected, then the different contribution rates
apply to each band of earnings, in a similar way to income tax. For
example, say we have the bands below. The contributions paid for a
member earning £100,000 are set out in the table below.

Band | Range           | Employer Contribution Rate | Contributions Calculated As
-----|----------------:|---------------------------:|----------------------------
1    | 0 – 12,600      | 5.5%                       | 0.055 &times; £12,600 = £693 on her Band 1 earnings
2    | 12,601 – 14,700 | 5.8%                       | 0.058 &times; £(14,700–12,600) = £121.80 on her Band 2 earnings
3    | 14,701 – 18,900 | 5.9%                       | 0.059 &times; £(18,900–14,700) = £247.80 on her Band 3 earnings
4    | 18,901 – 31,500 | 6.5%                       | 0.065 &times; £(31,500–18,900) = £819.00 on her Band 4 earnings
5    | 31,501 – 42,000 | 6.8%                       | 0.068 &times; £(42,000–31,500) = £714.00 on her Band 5 earnings
6    | 42,001 – 78,700 | 7.5%                       | 0.075 &times; £(78,700–42,000) = £2,752.50 on her Band 6 earnings
7    | 78,701 – 81,500 | 7.7%                       | 0.077 &times; £(81,500–78,700) = £215.60 on her Band 7 earnings
8    | 81,501 – 84,000 | 7.9%                       | 0.079 &times; £(84,000–81,500) = £197.50 on her Band 8 earnings
9    | 84,001 – 89,000 | 8.2%                       | 0.082 &times; £(89,000–84,000) = £410.00 on her Band 9 earnings
10   | &gt;89,001      | 8.5%                       | 0.085 &times; £(100,000–89,000) = £935.00 on her Band 10 earnings
     |                 |                            | Total Contributions Paid would be £7,106.20 per year

If `Band-Related` is selected then a single contribution rate is paid
based on the member’s total salary. The rate depends on the Band in
which the member’s salary lies. Under this approach, the contributions
paid for a member earning £100,000 would be calculated as 0.085 &times;
£100,000 = £8,500 per year. (The member’s salary lies in the range
covered by Band 10 and so the Band 10 contribution rate is applies to
their entire salary.)
