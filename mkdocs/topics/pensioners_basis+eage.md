# Benefit Ceasing Age

This can be used to stop payment of a pension early.

Enter the age at which the member’s or spouse’s pension payments will
cease. For example, a temporary pension may be payable between
retirement age and SPA. In this case SPA would be the Benefit Ceasing
Age.

Enter 120 if the pension is payable for life. (This represents the end
of the mortality table.)
