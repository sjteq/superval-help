# Start Date

If either the [ERF Indicator](deferreds_basis+barbind.md) (or the GMP
ERF Indicators) are set to `Use Barber Start and End Dates` or the
[Include in Underpin](deferreds_basis+undind.md) is set to `Split
According to Service` then SuperVal requires a Start Date and a Finish
Date for each of the PUPs.

The Start Date can either be fixed for all members or variable. Enter a
fixed date in the form DD/MM/YYYY. To enter a variable date, select from
the drop-down list the appropriate data item.
