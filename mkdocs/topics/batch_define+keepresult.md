# Store Results for Consolidation

Check this box if you would like SuperVal to produce the valuation
results within the Excel File and to store these for consolidating at a
later date.

Leave this box unchecked to produce the text output only.

You may wish to leave this unchecked until you have completed the
initial checking of the valuation results. The valuation can then be
re-run and the consolidation output stored. Once selected, the results
of the run for each category will be written to database that will be
located in the Consolidation folder specified.
