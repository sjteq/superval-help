# First Year Increase

The proportion of pension increase applied in the first year is
dependent on up to 4 factors, namely:

-   When the benefit commences
-   The period between valuation and the pension increase date
-   The frequency and mode of pension payments
-   The pension increase timing.

Select from the drop-down list how the increase in the first year should
be determined. The options are:

-   Default
-   None
-   Proportional
-   Full

If "Default" is selected SuperVal assumes that, on average, people
retire halfway through the year. If the Payment Frequency is monthly,
the first pension increase will be awarded halfway through the month in
which pension increases become payable (or the review date if
specified). If the Payment Frequency is annual, first year increases are
only granted if the review date falls in the first six months after the
valuation date. The increase granted will reflect the period from the
review date to the mid-year. First year increases are not granted if the
review date falls in the second part of the first year. Subsequent
increases are valued in full on the anniversary of the commencement of
benefit. (This was the only method available prior to V8.50.)

If "None" is selected, no pension increase is valued at the first review
date or opportunity to pay pension increases following benefit
commencement.

If "Proportional" is selected, then a proportional pension increase is
valued at the first review date or opportunity to pay pension increases
following benefit commencement.

If "Full" is selected, then a full pension increase is valued at the
first review date or opportunity to pay pension increases following
benefit commencement.

## Examples

Examples illustrating how SuperVal applies pension increases under the
various methods are shown below:

Consider a £2000 annual pension payable monthly in advance from 1
January 2025. The pension increase applied is 5% p.a.

Assuming the same pension is paid annually in advance, the DEFAULT
option does not grant increases for review dates that fall after 01/07
and calculates the pension as follows:
