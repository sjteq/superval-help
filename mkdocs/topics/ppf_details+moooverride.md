Users will not have to set up different bases for ongoing runs and PPF
runs when they want to override the field `Ignore the DBR` in the PUP
tab.

The highlighted field below under the PPF global parameters when ticked
will override the `Ignore for DBR` according to the PPF Service period
field described for each PUP. The Pre 1997 will be overridden to `Yes`
and the Post 1997 will be overridden to `No`.
