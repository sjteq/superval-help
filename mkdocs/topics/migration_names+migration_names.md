# The Migration Names Table

The purpose of the Migration Names Table is to enable the user to
provide consistent pointer names for each of the different Global
Parameters created in SuperVal V9.00 as part of the Migration Process. A
Migration Table can also be imported from different Input Folders to
enable a consistent approach to be taken across different schemes and
input folders.

For each of the different assumptions and for each of the three
Membership Groups the user should enter the pointer name that should be
used. For example, to label all of the pre retirement interest rates
PreInt 1, PreInt 2 etc then enter `PreInt` as the Migration Name for _Pre
Retirement Interest_ where appropriate. The Migration Name should not be
longer than 40 characters and can contain spaces.

When migrating the Basis Files, select the appropriate Migration Table
and click _Next_. The migration process will label the pointers for the
assumptions appropriately.
