# Cap Offset

If an active or deferred member is already receiving a retirement
pension from this or another scheme, then the Compensation Cap at
retirement will be reduced to reflect this. Select from the drop-down
list the data item containing the percentage of the Cap already used.
SuperVal will then take account of this when determining any restriction
in benefits due to the Cap at future retirement ages.
