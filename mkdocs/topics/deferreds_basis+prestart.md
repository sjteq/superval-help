If you have selected to `Use Barber Start and End Dates` in either the
[Pre-1988 GMP ERF Indicator](deferreds_basis+bpreind.md) or the
[Post-1988 GMP ERF Indicator](deferreds_basis+bpreind.md) or `Split
According to Service` in the Pre/Post-1988 GMP Underpin Indicator then
SuperVal requires a Start Date and a Finish Date for the Pre-1988 GMP or
the Post-1988 GMP.

The Start Date can either be a fixed date or a data item. To use a fixed
date enter the date here. The date should be in the DD/MM/CCYY format.

containing the appropriate data.

SuperVal knows that the Pre-1988 GMP can only have been accrued between
6/4/1978 and 5/4/1988 and that the Post-1988 GMP can only have accrued
between 6/4/1988 and 5/4/1997 and uses this information in the
