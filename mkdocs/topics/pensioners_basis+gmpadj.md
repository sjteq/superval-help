# Include in Adjustment at SPA/Death

This option is only available if the [Reduce Pensions at
SPA](pensioners_basis+puprdn.md) box on the Legislation Tab has been
checked.

Check this box if the pension defined is to be included in the
adjustment when the GMP comes into payment at SPA or Death. The user
will then be required to enter the underlying GMP data on which to base
these calculations.
