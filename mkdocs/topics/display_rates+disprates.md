# Rates

The values of the Rate Table are displayed in a &lsqio;spreadsheetâ€™.

If you were in the Import Rates, Insert Rates, Delete Rates or Bulk
Annuities module, these rates are displayed for purposes of confirming
acceptance of the changes. Any changes made to the Rate Table (for
example, overwritten values or inserted values) will be coloured to
assist the recognition of the changes being made.

The range of Rates displayed are:

-   ages 0 to 119 for Age related Rate Tables (including Miscellaneous
    X-tables);
-   durations 0 to 59 for Duration related Rate Tables (including
    Miscellaneous T-tables); and
-   dimensions (related to Age (Y-axis) and Duration (X-axis) for
    decrement rates) of 120 values for 2-Dimensional Rate Tables
    (including Miscellaneous M tables).
