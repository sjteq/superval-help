# Revalue Pre-1997 1/160

Where the Death in Deferment Benefit is the greater of the GMP and
1/160, then this field allows the 1/160th death in deferment pension
from the Offset Past Service to be revalued in deferment before being
compared to the spouseâ€™s GMP.

Check this box if you want the Offset Past Service 1/160th pension to be
revalued in deferment. Leave this box unchecked if this pension is not
revalued in deferment.

Please note that 6/4/1997 is not automatically used by SuperVal. The
`Pre-1997` in the title is purely a label (reflecting most likely date).
