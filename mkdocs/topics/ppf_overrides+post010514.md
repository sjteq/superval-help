Check this box if you are running a post 1 May 2014 S143 Valuation.

Once checked, the user will be required to enter a Heavy and a Light
Mortality Table for use in the S143 Valuation and the appropriate
adjustment factors. These will only be used in S143 valuations with an
effective date after 1 May 2014. The central table will have been
entered above in the Male and Female Mortality Rate Fields. Together
these three tables will be used for male and female members based on
their pension in relation to the Compensation Cap as set out in the PPF
Guidance Notes. The S143 Heavy Table will be used for those with smaller
pensions, the Mortality Rate Table for those with mid-sized pensions and
the S143 Light Table for those with larger pensions. The split of
members into one of these three groups will be undertaken in accordance
with the guidance issued by the PPF.

Enter the adjustment to the table required in the `% Rating` field. To
reflect the current adjustment of 90% enter `-10`.
