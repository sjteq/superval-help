# Spouse’s Reversion %

This field is used in the Pensioners Module to determine both the
proportion of the member’s pension payable on death after retirement and
death in deferment.

Input the spouse’s reversion factor as a percentage i.e. for 50% enter `50`
rather than `0.5`. If the pension is a single life pension then this
parameter should be set to 0%.

If the spouse’s pension varies by member, this field should be left
blank, and the relevant data item entered into [Spouse’s Pension
Amount](pensioners_basis+spendata.md).
