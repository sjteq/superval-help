If either of the `Calendar Year`, `Specified Year of Birth` or `Accurate
(Member Specific)` Methods has been selected then double click to select
the age related rate table (e.g. type `HX`) containing the values for
beta(x) at each age.

CMI No. 17 suggests an age related step function after 20 years
(suggested beta(x) for f20). SuperVal requires a `HX` type table
containing the beta(x) values:

Beta(x)

\= 0.55 X&lt;60

\= 0.55 &times; (110-X)/50 + 0.29 &times; (X-60)/50 60≤X≤110

\= 0.29 X&gt;110

CMI No. 10 suggests a value of 60% after 20 years (suggested value for
f20); SuperVal requires an `HX` type table containing 0.6 for all ages.
