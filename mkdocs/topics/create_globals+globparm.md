# Create\_Globals+globParm

There are four checkboxes here

Global names for Actives, Deferreds and Pensioners can be kept separate
if this option is checked. If unchecked the Global names will be merged
and used across modules when possible.

If the Decrement Types is checked, then different types of decrement
such as Retirement or Ill Health would have global names created with
the type of decrement in the name.

If Field types is checked then the global names will be differentiated
by parameter type

If Sex is checked, the global names will contain the sex in the global
names.
