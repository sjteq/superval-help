# Membership Growth Vector

You must specify a vector of the growth or decline in membership of the
Scheme. New entrants are added at the start of each Scheme year, the
start of the first year being the valuation date.

The vector is related to the number of members valued in the group plus
the number of immediate new entrants specified. The first number in the
vector will represent the size of the Scheme at the end of the first
year, the second number representing the number of members at the end of
the second year, etc.

The last element of the vector is assumed to continue to the end of the
projection period.
