# Cash Flow File

The following functionality can be used to calculate the internal rate
of return for a series of cashflows.

Enter the filename of the .txt file containing the cash flow information
in the Scheme Folder. The cash flows do not need to be in chronological
order.

This file must be in the format of a series of dates each followed by a
cash flow (there is no limit to the number of cash flows that can be
specified).

The opening Scheme balance should be shown as a positive cashflow and
the closing Scheme balance shown as a negative cash flow.

Double Clicking will produce a `standard` Dialog of the available data
files in the Scheme Folder.
