# The Add/Edit Default Names button

Clicking the _Add/Edit Default Names_ button allows you to create or edit
a set of Migration Names. The text entered in the Migration Names will
be used as the Global Variable Name for all of the Global Parameters
migrated of that type.

If a set of Migration Names does not exist, then you will be taken
directly to the Migration Names Table where you can enter the default
name to be used for each variable.

If a single set of Migration Names already exists, then you will be
taken directly to this set to enable changes to be made.

If more than one set of Migration Names already exist, then you will be
taken to the Parameter Selection Box to choose which set to open.
