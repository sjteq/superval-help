# Promotional Salary Scale Table

Promotional salary scales are salary increases that are provided in
addition to the general salary increases previously specified.

Double click to select from either an age related promotional salary
scale (`S` Type) or a service related promotional salary scale (`ST`
Type). For both types, the table will contain the year on year rates
(and not cumulative rates).

When using a service related promotional scale the user will be required
to input the date from which service will be calculated in the [Date for
Durational Decrements](actives_basis+durndate.md) field on the
Demographic Tab.

General salary increases are normally specified in the [Salary
Increase](actives_basis+salinc.md) field on the Financial Tab.
Alternatively, for a particular salary definition this can be overridden
by the [Salary Increase Override](actives_basis+salinf.md) on the
Salaries Tab.

Some options are only available to some users.
