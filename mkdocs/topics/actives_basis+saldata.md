# Data Item for Salary

Select from the drop-down list the data item containing the salary to be
used within this salary definition.

This would typically be the data item containing the (pensionable)
salary as at the valuation date. It could be either of the standard
data item Current Salary or Previous Salary or one of the numeric
non-standard data items.

If the actual Final Pensionable Salary data item (including averaging)
at the valuation date is available then this should be entered into the
[Initial Final Average Salary](actives_basis+fasdata.md) field.
