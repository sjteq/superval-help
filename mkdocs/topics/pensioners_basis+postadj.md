# Post-88 GMP Adjustment Factor

A negative or positive loading can be applied to the Post-1988 GMP.

The entered adjustment is applied to the standard data item. Enter the
number as a multiplier i.e. `1.1` for a 10% increase or `0.9` for a 10%
decrease. If no adjustment is required enter `1`. If `0` is entered the
liability for the Post-1988 GMP will be zero.
