# Cash Cap: Adjustment Factor

A negative or positive loading can be applied to the Cash Cap.

If no adjustment is required enter `1`. If `0` is entered the liability
for the Cash Cap will be zero.

This field can be used to allow for any contingencies, such as
childrenâ€™s pensions, which are not valued by SuperVal.
