# Ceasing Age

The age at which annuity payments will cease in years and months
(expressed in terms of the age of the primary annuitant).

The maximum allowable age of 120 will include payments for the life of
the primary annuitant (and reversionary payments, if any, for the life
of the reversionary annuitant).
