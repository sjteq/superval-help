# Timing of Salary Increases

Select from the drop-down list the timing of salary increases. The
options are:

-   Review Date
-   Continuous
-   Weighted

If `Review Date` is selected, salaries will be updated on the date
entered in Review Date.

If `Continuous` is selected, salaries will be increased continuously.

If `Weighted` is selected, salaries will be updated on the date entered
in Review Date but weighted when calculating Final Average Salary.

The projection of Salary is the same for both Review Date and Weighted.

The difference relates to the calculation of Final Average Salary. Under
Review Date, Final Average Salary is the average salary as at the last N
review dates. Under Weighted, Final Average Salary is the average salary
over the last N years. Hence, Review Date can be used to model Final
Average Salaries that only increase once a year on the Review Date
whereas Weighted is used to model Final Average Salaries that increase
continuously during the year.

For more information on how these different salaries are calculated
please see the Infocus Document relating to Salary Projections in
