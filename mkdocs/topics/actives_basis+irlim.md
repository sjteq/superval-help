# IR Maximum Parameters: Application

Select from the drop-down list how to apply the Inland Revenue Maximum
Rules to the retirement and cash benefits. The options are:

-   Limit Future First
-   Proportionate

Under `Limit Future First` the future service benefit will be restricted
by the Inland Revenue Limit Maximum first.

Under `Proportionate` any Inland Revenue Limit will apply
proportionately to past and future service benefits.

Consider the following example:

 &nbsp;                | Prior to application | Limit Future First | Proportionate
