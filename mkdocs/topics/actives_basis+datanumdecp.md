# Decimal Places

In order to get the correct precision, you must specify the number of
decimal places to be displayed.

An input data field such as a Benefit Multiple will require a few
decimal places but an accumulation of contributions will be accurate
enough if rounded to the nearest pound. The Data File created will
contain the values entered into the Value field rounded to this number
of decimal places.
