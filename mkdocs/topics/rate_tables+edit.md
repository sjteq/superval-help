# The Edit button

When a Rate Table is highlighted (and you have been given the
appropriate access level), an Edit Button will become enabled.

On pressing the _Edit_ button, the Rate Table (and its Rate Table number
and description) can be modified.

Note that after the _Edit_ button is pressed and until the editing is
completed or aborted, the Rate Table file is locked to stop other users
from making simultaneous changes to this Rate Table file (which may
cause corruption of the file). Thus it is recommended that the shortest
time possible be spent in this mode.
