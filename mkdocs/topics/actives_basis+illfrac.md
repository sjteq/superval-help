# Ill Health Future Service Fraction

This is used where the Ill health [Benefit
Basis](actives_basis+illind.md) is a Prospective Pension.

If the prospective service is to count in full then this field should be
set to 100%. If prospective service only counts at half rate then this
field should be set to 50%.

More information on how the cost of the prospective element is accrued
is found in the [Spreading Method](actives_basis+stype.md) and
[Spreading Dates](actives_basis+ssd.md).
