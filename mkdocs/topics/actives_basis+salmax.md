# SALmax/SALmaxF

Enter the amount of salary maximum you wish to apply. This can either be
a fixed amount for all members or a member specific amount.

To use a fixed value across all members, enter the value here. To use a
member specific value, select from the drop-down list the appropriate
data item.

For example, if the pensionable salary definition is restricted by the
Earnings Cap, then enter the Earnings Cap as at the valuation date in
this field.

If both a maximum and a deduction are used, then the maximum is applied
before the deduction i.e. entering a maximum of Upper Earnings Limit and
deduction of a Lower Earnings Limit would give Band Earnings.
