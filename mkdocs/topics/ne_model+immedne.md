# Immediate New Entrants

As details of new entrant experience immediately after the valuation
date can be accurately known, you are able to specify a number of
immediate new entrants joining at the valuation date. These members will
be assumed to enter at the valuation date.

This number should include the replacement of any members that have been
valued outside the SuperVal system. Note that any members over normal
retirement age valued within SuperVal will be replaced immediately at
the valuation date by SuperVal.
