# Import_Ranges+SavedParms

The Import Validation Ranges allows Users to copy ranges used previously
for the Membership class. So if you have previously set up Validation
Ranges for running Data Validation, these can be copied as the starting
point for current Validation Ranges. e.g. 

-   `Data Build Actives 2018.csv`, set Validation ranges when validating 
-   `Data Build Actives 2019.csv`, copy Validation Ranges used in Data Build of `Actives 2018.csv` avoiding replication of setting Validation Ranges again, as `Actives 2018.csv` and `Actives 2019.csv` will usually have the same user-defined fields.
