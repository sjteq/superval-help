# Rate Table File

Whenever a user begins to add, edit or delete a Rate Table file, the
file is locked to stop other users from also making changes to that
file. In the event that their changes are not completed (due to either a
reboot or a system error), the file may need to be &lsquo;releasedâ€™ to allow
changes to be made.

A list of the Rate Table Files that are currently locked is displayed.

If you wish for a Rate Table File to be released, select that file and
press _OK_.

Ensure that the user shown is not in the process of making changes to
that file as allowing others to make changes at the same time may result
in corruption of the Rate Table file.
