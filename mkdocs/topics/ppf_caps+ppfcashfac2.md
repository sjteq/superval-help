# Cash Factor (Pre-97)

Double click to select the cash factors to apply where schemes provide
retirement cash on-top of pension. (Cash commutation is ignored for PPF
Valuations.) The cash factors are used to convert cash into pension
(cash/factor) and then added to actual pension before comparing with the
PPF Benefit Cap.

The Cash factor should be in the same format as commutation factors,
i.e. `11` or `9` at relevant ages.
