# Spouse’s DIS Pension Insured: Rate Loading

If the cost of insuring a particular group of people (ie those in
hazardous occupations) is higher a loading to the standard rates can be
made. Enter the amount of the loading here. The loading should be input
as a percentage i.e. to increase the rates by 20% enter a loading of 120%.
For no adjustment enter a 100%.

Note, the insured costing for the Spouse’s Death in Service will be
costed per £100 per annum. Therefore, if this has not already been taken
account of in the premium rates (i.e. your premium rates are simply 
$qx \times ax$) you will need a rate loading of $100 \times 100% = 10,000%$.
