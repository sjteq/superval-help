# Type of Numeric Data

The type field is a display only field reminding you of the type of the
numeric data item.

The distinction is only relevant for the New Entrant Model Replacement
when multiple members are assumed in the New Entrant Proportions. The
New Entrant Data Default for a `Total` Numeric non-standard data field
will be multiplied by the number of members whereas the `Average`
Numeric non-standard data field will not.

An example of a `Total` Numeric non-standard data field might be a
salary source item (as the total salary for the group of members is
assumed) whereas an example of an `Average` non-standard data field
might be an additional contribution rate (where the same rate applies
irrespective of the number of members).
