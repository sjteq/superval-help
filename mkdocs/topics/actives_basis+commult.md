# Commutation Multiple

This field is only required if the Cash Calculations are based on a
`Multiple of Pension`. The Multiple can either be fixed for all members
or member specific.

To use a fixed multiple, enter the multiple here. (Using a multiple of 3
is the same as selecting `3 &times; pension`.)

To value a member specific multiple, select from the drop-down list the
data item containing the appropriate data.
