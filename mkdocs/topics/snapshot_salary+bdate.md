# Members Investigated

The cohort of members to be investigated can be controlled by specifying
two dates between which members must have joined to be included for
investigation.

A date of `01/01/1901` and the Current Valuation Date as specified
initially. This would include all members active at the Current
Valuation Date in the investigation. Dates can be entered in almost any
format and they will be automatically converted to DD/MM/YYYY format.

If your data records do not contain either of the joining dates, all
members are investigated irrespective of these parameters.

These parameters enable:

-   investigation of the promotional salary scale durationally; or
-   to investigate, for example, only members who were in-force at the
    previous valuation date.

Pairs of Snapshot Salary investigation runs can be carried out to
produce some comparable averages over the inter-valuation period.

To determine the increase in Average Scheme Salary over the
inter-valuation period (increases due to inflation only) compare the
averages from:

1.  Investigate members joining between `01/01/1901` and the Current
    Valuation Date based on Current Salary with a Calculation Date of
    the Current Valuation Date.
2.  Investigate members joining between `01/01/1901` and the Previous
    Valuation Date based on Previous Salary with a Calculation Date of
    the Previous Valuation Date.

To determine the increase in Average Salary for members in-force
throughout the inter-valuation period (increases due to inflation and
promotion) compare the averages from:

1.  Investigate members joining between `01/01/1901` and the Previous
    Valuation Date based on Current Salary with a Calculation Date of
    the Current Valuation Date.
2.  Investigate members joining between `01/01/1901` and the Previous
    Valuation Date based on Previous Salary with a Calculation Date of
    the Current Valuation Date.
