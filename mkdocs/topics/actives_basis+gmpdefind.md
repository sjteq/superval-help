# Revalue to NRA&lt;SPA

Check this box if NRA is less than SPA and the GMP is revalued at a
different rate to NRA. If NRA is equal to SPA then leave this field
unchecked and the statutory revaluation will be correctly applied.

If checked, SuperVal will apply the [Revaluation Rate to NRA&lt;
SPA](actives_basis+gmprevalrat.md) to the GMP up to NRA. Then at SPA it
will make an addition for all the statutory revaluations on the GMP not
yet in payment (subject to the [Franking Code](bases+offcod.md) ).
