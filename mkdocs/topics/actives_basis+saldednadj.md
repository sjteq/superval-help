# Deduction Loading Adjustment

This field allows the user to adjust the deduction by a fixed factor. It
might be used where the data used for the deduction is out of date and
needs to be increased to take account of an extra part year of
inflation.  
Enter the number as a multiplier, e.g. `1.1` for a 10% increase or `0.9` for
a 10% decrease. For no adjustment enter a value of `1`.

This field can also be used to add the deduction amount on to the
salary. To do this ensure the value entered is negative i.e. `-1` to add the
deduction, without adjustment, onto the salary.
