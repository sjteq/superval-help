# Pre-1988/Post-1988 GMP: Underpin Indicator

This field is only available if the Benefits Underpinned on the Underpin
Tab has been checked. It will be used to define how the Pre-1988 GMP or
Post-1988 GMP should be treated for Underpin purposes. The options are:

-   Exclude
-   Include
-   Split According To Service

If `Split According To Service` is selected then the user will be
required to enter the Start and Finish Dates for the GMP benefits.
SuperVal will then use these dates to determine the proportion of the
Pre-1988 GMP or Post-1988 GMP that is before or after the Underpin
Commencement Date on the Underpin Tab.
