Select from the drop-down list how to value the CARE Prospective benefit
on Death in Service or Ill-health. The options are:

-   Accrued CARE Pension
-   Current Salary

The following example sets out how the benefit will be calculated under
each of these options. Consider a member with a 1/50th CARE scheme who
has a pension of £4,000 which was accrued over ten years. His current
pay is £25,000 pa. On either death or ill-health retirement he will
receive an additional 20 years of service.

Under the Accrued Care Method his death/ill-health pension will be
calculated as 

$$£4,000 + \frac{£4,000}{10} \times 20 = £12,000  $$

Under the Current Salary Method his death/ill-health pension will be
calculated as 

$$£4,000 + £25,000 \times \frac{20}{50} = £14,000$$
