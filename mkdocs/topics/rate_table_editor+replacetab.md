# Replace Original Rate Table with New Rate Table

When in Edit mode and if a new Rate Table code is selected, you should
indicate if the existing Rate Table is to be replaced by the new Rate
Table.

This enables you to either:

-   create a new Rate Table based on the values of an existing Rate
    Table (and not replace the existing Rate Table); or
-   rename an existing Rate Table (by replacing the existing Rate
    Table).
