# End Age

The End Age is the maximum age at which investigation results will be
output to the file (or in the review of the investigation, the graphical
display).

It is rounded to the next highest multiple of the Grouping of Data
factor from the Start Age.

Note that the results for all ages are calculated (and saved). The End
Age can be adjusted when reviewing the investigation results.
