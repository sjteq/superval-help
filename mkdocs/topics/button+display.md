# The Display button

Using the _Display_ button while looking at Rate Tables will display the
changes made to the currently specified rate table.  
Pressing the _Display_ button elsewhere pop-ups a window which allows you
to display a member record with a ruler to determine column
specifications. On the Display window, you can specify the name of the
data file (.dat file) and record number from that file.
