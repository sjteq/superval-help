# Scheme Basis File Name

The name of the Scheme Basis Parameter file into which the basis
parameters will be saved. This file is automatically given an extension
of `.SF`.

With parameter sets that are stored at the Category Level, any number of
parameter sets can be stored in a parameter file and there can be any
number of parameter files.

If any Scheme Basis Parameter File(s) already exist in the Scheme
Folder, they will be displayed in the list. If there are more than one,
you must select the one you wish to save the parameters to.

If there are no Scheme Basis Parameter files in the Scheme Folder, the
list displayed will be blank. In this case (or if you wish to create a
new Scheme Level Parameters File), you must type in the name of the
Scheme Basis Parameter File.

It is recommended to specify a name that describes the purpose of the
bases (particularly if there is more than one Basis Parameter File in
the Scheme Folder) so that the file will be easily recognisable at a
later date.

The preferred configuration is to have only one parameter file with
category level parameters but there may be situations where more than
one may be preferred.

For example, one parameter file might contain category level bases with
the previous valuation basis and bases with the new valuation basis in a
second file or bases for each actives category could be in one file and
another file could contain bases for each pensioners category (although
in both these examples all `bases` could be saved to the same parameter
file, if preferred).
