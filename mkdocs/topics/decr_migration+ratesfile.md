# Superval/21 Rate Tables File

The Superval/21 Rate Tables file (DECR.sf in the Superval/21 System
directory) to be migrated can be located in the system folder of
Superval/21.

To be distinguished from the Superval/21 Rate Tables file the SuperVal
Rate Tables file will be named `SVDECR.sf`. Note that once converted the
new file cannot be used in the Superval/21 system again as the index of
the file has been converted to a new format (the original file will, of
course, still exist).
