# Barber End Date

This field is used to define the end of the Barber Period after which
males and females must have equal NRA. It will be available when `Use
Barber Start and End dates` is selected for the [ERF
Indicator](deferreds_basis+barbind.md) on the Pups Tab or either the
[Pre-1988 ERF Indicator](deferreds_basis+bpreind.md) or the [Post-1988
ERF Indicator](deferreds_basis+mpreind.md) on the Legislation Tab.

Enter the Barber End Date in DD/MM/YYYY format.

Where an early retirement decrement applies, Early Retirement Pension
Reduction Factors will need to be specified separately for males and
females for the periods

-   prior to Barber Date
-   inside the Barber Window i.e. 17/5/1990 to the date of equalisation
    and
-   after the date of equalisation i.e. Barber End Date.

For males, SuperVal will apply ERF2 between Barber Start Date and Barber
End Date and ERF1 for all other periods of service. For females,
SuperVal will apply ERF2 for service prior to the Barber End Date and
ERF1 for service after this date.
