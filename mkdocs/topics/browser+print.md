# The Print button

Pressing the _Print_ button enables printing of:

-   all of the currently displayed file;
-   the currently displayed page;
-   a selection of multiple pages; or
-   the currently selected text on the currently displayed page.

Printer settings (the printer, orientation, left and top margins and
font) can also be set.

The entire file or the current page can also be printed using the
`floating` button bar (on the printer selected on the button bar also) â€“
all other settings (orientation, left and top margins and font) will be
the last saved printer settings.
