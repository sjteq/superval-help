This is a template for a Help page introduction.

It will appear at the top of the eponymous Help page.

It should contain one or more paragraphs (P), as this template does. It
can also include ordered lists (OL), unordered lists (UL). images (IMG),
or BLOCKQUOTE elements.

Don't use DIV elements or headings, eg H1, H2, H3. The introduction will
appear above the first parameter heading.
